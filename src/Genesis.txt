In the beginning God created heaven and earthBut the earth was empty and unoccupied and darknesses were over the face of the abyss and so the Spirit of God was brought over the watersAnd God said Let there be light And light becameAnd God saw the light that it was good and so he divided the light from the darknessesAnd he called the light Day and the darknesses Night And it became evening and morning one dayGod also said Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters and let it divide waters from watersAnd God made a firmament and he divided the waters that were under the firmament from those that were above the firmament And so it becameAnd God called the firmament Heaven And it became evening and morning the second dayTruly God said Let the waters that are under heaven be gathered together into one place and let the dry land appear And so it becameAnd God called the dry land Earth and he called the gathering of the waters Seas And God saw that it was goodAnd he said Let the land spring forth green plants both those producing seed and fruit-bearing trees producing fruit according to their kind whose seed is within itself over all the earth And so it becameAnd the land brought forth green plants both those producing seed according to their kind and trees producing fruit with each having its own way of sowing according to its species And God saw that it was goodAnd it became evening and the morning the third dayThen God said Let there be lights in the firmament of heaven And let them divide day from night and let them become signs both of the seasons and of the days and yearsLet them shine in the firmament of heaven and illuminate the earth And so it becameAnd God made two great lights a greater light to rule over the day and a lesser light to rule over the night along with the starsAnd he set them in the firmament of heaven to give light over all the earthand to rule over the day as well as the night and to divide light from darkness And God saw that it was goodAnd it became evening and morning the fourth dayAnd then God said Let the waters produce animals with a living soul and flying creatures above the earth under the firmament of heavenAnd God created the great sea creatures and everything with a living soul and the ability to move that the waters produced according to their species and all the flying creatures according to their kind And God saw that it was goodAnd he blessed them saying Increase and multiply and fill the waters of the sea And let the birds be multiplied above the landAnd it became evening and morning the fifth dayGod also said Let the land produce living souls in their kind cattle and animals and wild beasts of the earth according to their species And so it becameAnd God made the wild beasts of the earth according to their species and the cattle and every animal on the land according to its kind And God saw that it was goodAnd he said Let us make Man to our image and likeness And let him rule over the fish of the sea and the flying creatures of the air and the wild beasts and the entire earth and every animal that moves on the earthAnd God created man to his own image to the image of God he created him male and female he created themAnd God blessed them and he said Increase and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and the flying creatures of the air and over every living thing that moves upon the earthAnd God said Behold I have given you every seed-bearing plant upon the earth and all the trees that have in themselves the ability to sow their own kind to be food for youand for all the animals of the land and for all the flying things of the air and for everything that moves upon the earth and in which there is a living soul so that they may have these on which to feed And so it becameAnd God saw everything that he had made And they were very good And it became evening and morning the sixth dayAnd so the heavens and the earth were completed with all their adornmentAnd on the seventh day God fulfilled his work which he had made And on the seventh day he rested from all his work which he had accomplishedAnd he blessed the seventh day and sanctified it For in it he had ceased from all his work the work whereby God created whatever he should makeThese are the generations of heaven and earth when they were created in the day when the Lord God made heaven and earthand every sapling of the field before it would rise up in the land and every wild plant before it would germinate For the Lord God had not brought rain upon the earth and there was no man to work the landBut a fountain ascended from the earth irrigating the entire surface of the landAnd then the Lord God formed man from the clay of the earth and he breathed into his face the breath of life and man became a living soulNow the Lord God had planted a Paradise of enjoyment from the beginning In it he placed the man whom he had formedAnd from the soil the Lord God produced every tree that was beautiful to behold and pleasant to eat And even the tree of life was in the midst of Paradise and the tree of the knowledge of good and evilAnd a river went forth from the place of enjoyment so as to irrigate Paradise which is divided from there into four headsThe name of one is the Phison it is that which runs through all the land of Hevilath where gold is bornand the gold of that land is the finest In that place is found bdellium and the onyx stoneAnd the name of the second river is the Gehon it is that which runs through all the land of EthiopiaTruly the name of the third river is the Tigris it advances opposite the Assyrians But the fourth river it is the EuphratesThus the Lord God brought the man and put him into the Paradise of enjoyment so that it would be attended and preserved by himAnd he instructed him saying From every tree of Paradise you shall eatBut from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat For in whatever day you will eat from it you will die a deathThe Lord God also said It is not good for the man to be alone Let us make a helper for him similar to himselfTherefore the Lord God having formed from the soil all the animals of the earth and all the flying creatures of the air brought them to Adam in order to see what he would call them For whatever Adam would call any living creature that would be its nameAnd Adam called each of the living things by their names all the flying creatures of the air and all the wild beasts of the land Yet truly for Adam there was not found a helper similar to himselfAnd so the Lord God sent a deep sleep upon Adam And when he was fast asleep he took one of his ribs and he completed it with flesh for itAnd the Lord God built up the rib which he took from Adam into a woman And he led her to AdamAnd Adam said Now this is bone from my bones and flesh from my flesh This one shall be called woman because she was taken from manFor this reason a man shall leave behind his father and mother and he shall cling to his wife and the two shall be as one fleshNow they were both naked Adam of course and his wife And they were not ashamedHowever the serpent was more crafty than any of the creatures of the earth that the Lord God had made And he said to the woman Why has God instructed you that you should not eat from every tree of ParadiseThe woman responded to him From the fruit of the trees which are in Paradise we eatYet truly from the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of Paradise God has instructed us that we should not eat and that we should not touch it lest perhaps we may dieThen the serpent said to the woman By no means will you die a deathFor God knows that on whatever day you will eat from it your eyes will be opened and you will be like gods knowing good and evilAnd so the woman saw that the tree was good to eat and beautiful to the eyes and delightful to consider And she took from its fruit and she ate And she gave to her husband who ateAnd the eyes of them both were opened And when they realized themselves to be naked they joined together fig leaves and made coverings for themselvesAnd when they had heard the voice of the Lord God taking a walk in Paradise in the afternoon breeze Adam and his wife hid themselves from the face of the Lord God in the midst of the trees of ParadiseAnd the Lord God called Adam and said to him Where are youAnd he said I heard your voice in Paradise and I was afraid because I was naked and so I hid myselfHe said to him Then who told you that you were naked if you have not eaten of the tree from which I instructed you that you should not eatAnd Adam said The woman whom you gave to me as a companion gave to me from the tree and I ateAnd the Lord God said to the woman Why have you done this And she responded The serpent deceived me and I ateAnd the Lord God said to the serpent Because you have done this you are cursed among all living things even the wild beasts of the earth Upon your breast shall you travel and the ground shall you eat all the days of your lifeI will put enmities between you and the woman between your offspring and her offspring She will crush your head and you will lie in wait for her heelTo the woman he also said I will multiply your labors and your conceptions In pain shall you give birth to sons and you shall be under your husbands power and he shall have dominion over youYet truly to Adam he said Because you have listened to the voice of your wife and have eaten of the tree from which I instructed you that you should not eat cursed is the land that you work In hardship shall you eat from it all the days of your lifeThorns and thistles shall it produce for you and you shall eat the plants of the earthBy the sweat of your face shall you eat bread until you return to the earth from which you were taken For dust you are and unto dust you shall returnAnd Adam called the name of his wife Eve because she was the mother of all the livingThe Lord God also made for Adam and his wife garments from skins and he clothed themAnd he said Behold Adam has become like one of us knowing good and evil Therefore now perhaps he may put forth his hand and also take from the tree of life and eat and live in eternityAnd so the Lord God sent him away from the Paradise of enjoyment in order to work the earth from which he was takenAnd he cast out Adam And in front of the Paradise of enjoyment he placed the Cherubim with a flaming sword turning together to guard the way to the tree of lifeTruly Adam knew his wife Eve who conceived and gave birth to Cain saying I have obtained a man through GodAnd again she gave birth to his brother Abel But Abel was a pastor of sheep and Cain was a farmerThen it happened after many days that Cain offered gifts to the Lord from the fruits of the earthAbel likewise offered from the firstborn of his flock and from their fat And the Lord looked with favor on Abel and his giftsYet in truth he did not look with favor on Cain and his gifts And Cain was vehemently angry and his countenance fellAnd the Lord said to him Why are you angry And why is your face fallenIf you behave well will you not receive But if you behave badly will not sin at once be present at the door And so its desire will be within you and you will be dominated by itAnd Cain said to his brother Abel Let us go outside And when they were in the field Cain rose up against his brother Abel and he put him to deathAnd the Lord said to Cain Where is your brother Abel And he responded I do not know Am I my brothers keeperAnd he said to him What have you done The voice of your brothers blood cries out to me from the landNow therefore you will be cursed upon the land which opened its mouth and received the blood of your brother at your handWhen you work it it will not give you its fruit a vagrant and a fugitive shall you be upon the landAnd Cain said to the Lord My iniquity is too great to deserve kindnessBehold you have cast me out this day before the face of the earth and from your face I will be hidden and I will be a vagrant and a fugitive on the earth Therefore anyone who finds me will kill meAnd the Lord said to him By no means will it be so rather whoever would kill Cain will be punished sevenfold And the Lord placed a seal upon Cain so that anyone who found him would not put him to deathAnd so Cain departing from the face of the Lord lived as a fugitive on the earth toward the eastern region of EdenThen Cain knew his wife and she conceived and gave birth to Enoch And he built a city and he called its name by the name of his son EnochThereafter Enoch conceived Irad and Irad conceived Mahujael and Mahujael conceived Mathusael and Mathusael conceived LamechLamech took two wives the name of one was Adah and the name of the other was ZillahAnd Adah conceived Jabel who was the father of those who live in tents and are shepherdsAnd the name of his brother was Jubal he was the father of those who sing to the harp and the organZillah also conceived Tubalcain who was a hammerer and artisan in every work of brass and iron In fact the sister of Tubalcain was NoemaAnd Lamech said to his wives Adah and Zillah Listen to my voice you wives of Lamech pay attention to my speech For I have killed a man to my own harm and an adolescent to my own bruisingSevenfold vengeance will be given for Cain but for Lamech seventy-seven timesAdam also knew his wife again and she gave birth to a son and she called his name Seth saying God has given me another offspring in place of Abel whom Cain killedBut to Seth also was born a son whom he called Enos This one began to invoke the name of the LordThis is the book of the lineage of Adam In the day that God created man he made him to the likeness of GodHe created them male and female and he blessed them And he called their name Adam in the day when they were createdThen Adam lived for one hundred and thirty years And then he conceived a son in his own image and likeness and he called his name SethAnd after he conceived Seth the days of Adam that passed were eight hundred years And he conceived sons and daughtersAnd all the time that passed while Adam lived was nine hundred and thirty years and then he diedSeth likewise lived for one hundred and five years and then he conceived EnosAnd after he conceived Enos Seth lived for eight hundred and seven years and he conceived sons and daughtersAnd all the days of Seth that passed were nine hundred and twelve years and then he diedIn truth Enos lived ninety years and then he conceived CainanAfter his birth he lived eight hundred and fifteen years and he conceived sons and daughtersAnd all the days of Enos that passed were nine hundred and five years and then he diedLikewise Cainan lived seventy years and then he conceived MahalalelAnd after he conceived Mahalalel Cainan lived for eight hundred and forty years and he conceived sons and daughtersAnd all the days of Cainan that passed were nine hundred and ten years and then he diedAnd Mahalalel lived sixty-five years and then he conceived JaredAnd after he conceived Jared Mahalalel lived for eight hundred and thirty years and he conceived sons and daughtersAnd all the days of Mahalalel that passed were eight hundred and ninety-five years and then he diedAnd Jared lived for one hundred and sixty-two years and then he conceived EnochAnd after he conceived Enoch Jared lived for eight hundred years and he conceived sons and daughtersAnd all the days of Jared that passed were nine hundred and sixty-two years and then he diedNow Enoch lived for sixty-five years and then he conceived MethuselahAnd Enoch walked with God And after he conceived Methuselah he lived for three hundred years and he conceived sons and daughtersAnd all the days of Enoch that passed were three hundred and sixty-five yearsAnd he walked with God and then he was seen no more because God took himLikewise Methuselah lived for one hundred and eighty-seven years and then he conceived LamechAnd after he conceived Lamech Methuselah lived for seven hundred and eighty-two years and he conceived sons and daughtersAnd all the days of Methuselah that passed were nine hundred and sixty-nine years and then he diedThen Lamech lived for one hundred and eighty-two years and he conceived a sonAnd he called his name Noah saying This one will console us from the works and hardships of our hands in the land that the Lord has cursedAnd after he conceived Noah Lamech lived for five hundred and ninety-five years and he conceived sons and daughtersAnd all the days of Lamech that passed were seven hundred and seventy-seven years and then he died In truth when Noah was five hundred years old he conceived Shem Ham and JaphethAnd when men began to be multiplied upon the earth and daughters were born to themthe sons of God seeing that the daughters of men were beautiful took to themselves wives from all whom they choseAnd God said My spirit shall not remain in man forever because he is flesh And so his days shall be one hundred and twenty yearsNow giants were upon the earth in those days For after the sons of God went in to the daughters of men and they conceived these became the powerful ones of ancient times men of renownThen God seeing that the wickedness of men was great upon the earth and that every thought of their heart was intent upon evil at all timesrepented that he had made man on the earth And being touched inwardly with a sorrow of hearthe said I will eliminate man whom I have created from the face of the earth from man to other living things from animals even to the flying things of the air For it grieves me that I have made themYet truly Noah found grace before the LordThese are the generations of Noah Noah was a just man and yet he was predominate among his generations for he walked with GodAnd he conceived three sons Shem Ham and JaphethYet the earth was corrupted before the eyes of God and it was filled with iniquityAnd when God had seen that the earth had been corrupted indeed all flesh had corrupted its way upon the earthhe said to Noah The end of all flesh has arrived in my sight The earth has been filled with iniquity by their presence and I will destroy them along with the earthMake yourself an ark from smoothed wood You shall make little dwelling places in the ark and you shall smear pitch on the interior and exteriorAnd thus shall you make it The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits its width fifty cubits and its height thirty cubitsYou shall make a window in the ark and you shall complete it within a cubit of the top Then you shall set the door of the ark at its side You shall make in it a lower part upper rooms and a third levelBehold I shall bring the waters of a great flood upon the earth so as to put to death all flesh in which there is the breath of life under heaven All things that are on the earth shall be consumedAnd I shall establish my covenant with you and you shall enter the ark you and your sons your wife and the wives of your sons with youAnd from every living thing of all that is flesh you shall lead pairs into the ark so that they may survive with you from the male sex and the femalefrom birds according to their kind and from beasts in their kind and from among all animals on earth according to their kind pairs from each shall enter with you so that they may be able to liveTherefore you shall take with you from all the foods that are able to be eaten and you shall carry these with you And these shall be used as food some for you and the rest for themAnd so Noah did all things just as God had instructed himAnd the Lord said to him Enter the ark you and all your house For I have seen you to be just in my sight within this generationFrom all the clean animals take seven and seven the male and the female Yet truly from animals that are unclean take two and two the male and the femaleBut also from the birds of the air take seven and seven the male and the female so that offspring may be saved upon the face of the whole earthFor from that point and after seven days I will rain upon the earth for forty days and forty nights And I will wipe away every substance that I have made from the surface of the earthTherefore Noah did all things just as the Lord had commanded himAnd he was six hundred years old when the waters of the great flood inundated the earthAnd Noah entered into the ark and his sons his wife and the wives of his sons with him because of the waters of the great floodAnd from the animals both clean and unclean and from the birds and from everything that moves upon the earthtwo by two they were brought into the ark to Noah male and female just as the Lord had instructed NoahAnd when seven days had passed the waters of the great flood inundated the earthIn the six hundredth year of the life of Noah in the second month on the seventeenth day of the month all the fountains of the great abyss were released and the floodgates of heaven were openedAnd rain came upon the earth for forty days and forty nightsOn the very same day Noah and his sons Shem Ham and Japheth and his wife and the three wives of his sons with them entered the arkThey and every animal according to its kind and all the cattle in their kind and everything that moves upon the earth in their kind and every flying thing according to its kind all the birds and all that can flyentered the ark to Noah two by two out of all that is flesh in which there was the breath of lifeAnd those that entered went in male and female from all that is flesh just as God had instructed him And then the Lord closed him in from the outsideAnd the great flood occurred for forty days upon the earth And the waters were increased and they lifted the ark high above the landFor they overflowed greatly and they filled everything on the surface of the earth And then the ark was carried across the watersAnd the waters prevailed beyond measure across the earth And all the lofty mountains under the whole heaven were coveredThe water was fifteen cubits higher than the mountains which it coveredAnd all flesh was consumed which moved upon the earth flying things animals wild beasts and all moving things that crawl upon the ground And all menand everything in which there is the breath of life on earth diedAnd he wiped away all substance that was upon the earth from man to animal the crawling things just as much as the flying things of the air And they were wiped away from the earth But only Noah remained and those who were with him in the arkAnd the waters possessed the earth for one hundred and fifty daysThen God remembered Noah and all living things and all the cattle which were with him in the ark and he brought a wind across the earth and the waters were diminishedAnd the fountains of the abyss and the floodgates of heaven were closed And the rain from heaven was restrainedAnd the waters were restored to their coming and going from the earth And they began to diminish after one hundred and fifty daysAnd the ark rested in the seventh month on the twenty-seventh day of the month upon the mountains of ArmeniaYet in truth the waters were departing and decreasing until the tenth month For in the tenth month on the first day of the month the tips of the mountains appearedAnd when forty days had passed Noah opening the window that he had made in the ark sent forth a ravenwhich went forth and did not return until the waters were dried up across the earthLikewise he sent forth a dove after him in order to see if the waters had now ceased upon the face of the earthBut when she did not find a place where her foot might rest she returned to him in the ark For the waters were upon the whole earth And he extended his hand and caught her and he brought her into the arkAnd then having waited a further seven days he again sent forth the dove out of the arkAnd she came to him in the evening carrying in her mouth an olive branch with green leaves Noah then understood that the waters had ceased upon the earthAnd nevertheless he waited another seven days And he sent forth the dove which no longer returned to himTherefore in the six hundred and first year in the first month on the first day of the month the waters were diminished upon the earth And Noah opening the cover of the ark gazed out and saw that the surface of the earth had become dryIn the second month on the twenty-seventh day of the month the earth was made dryThen God spoke to Noah sayingGo out of the ark you and your wife your sons and the wives of your sons with youBring out with you all the living things that are with you all that is flesh as with the birds so also with the wild beasts and all the animals that move upon the earth And enter upon the land increase and multiply upon itAnd so Noah and his sons went out and his wife and the wives of his sons with himThen also all living things and the cattle and the animals that move upon the earth according to their kinds departed from the arkThen Noah built an altar to the Lord And taking from each of the cattle and birds that were clean he offered holocausts upon the altarAnd the Lord smelled the sweet odor and said I will no longer curse the earth because of man For the feelings and thoughts of the heart of man are prone to evil from his youth Therefore I will no longer pierce every living soul as I have doneAll the days of the earth seedtime and harvest cold and heat summer and winter night and day will not ceaseAnd God blessed Noah and his sons And he said to them Increase and multiply and fill the earthAnd let the fear and trembling of you be upon all the animals of the earth and upon all the birds of the air along with all that moves across the earth All the fish of the sea have been delivered into your handAnd everything that moves and lives will be food for you Just as with the edible plants I have delivered them all to youexcept that flesh with blood you shall not eatFor I will examine the blood of your lives at the hand of every beast So also at the hand of mankind at the hand of each man and his brother I will examine the life of mankindWhoever will shed human blood his blood will be poured out For man was indeed made to the image of GodBut as for you increase and multiply and go forth upon the earth and fulfill itTo Noah and to his sons with him God also said thisBehold I will establish my covenant with you and with your offspring after youand with every living soul that is with you as much with the birds as with the cattle and all the animals of the earth that have gone forth from the ark and with all the wild beasts of the earthI will establish my covenant with you and no longer will all that is flesh be put to death by the waters of a great flood and henceforth there will not be a great flood to utterly destroy the earthAnd God said This is the sign of the pact that I grant between me and you and to every living soul that is with you for perpetual generationsI will place my arc in the clouds and it will be the sign of the pact between myself and the earthAnd when I obscure the sky with clouds my arc will appear in the cloudsAnd I will remember my covenant with you and with every living soul that enlivens flesh And there will no longer be waters from a great flood to wipe away all that is fleshAnd the arc will be in the clouds and I will see it and I will remember the everlasting covenant that was enacted between God and every living soul of all that is flesh upon the earthAnd God said to Noah This will be the sign of the covenant that I have established between myself and all that is flesh upon the earthAnd so the sons of Noah who came out of the ark were Shem Ham and Japheth Now Ham himself is the father of CanaanThese three are the sons of Noah And from these all the family of mankind was spread over the whole earthAnd Noah a good farmer began to cultivate the land and he planted a vineyardAnd by drinking its wine he became inebriated and was naked in his tentBecause of this when Ham the father of Canaan had indeed seen the privates of his father to be naked he reported it to his two brothers outsideAnd truly Shem and Japheth put a cloak upon their arms and advancing backwards covered the privates of their father And their faces were turned away so that they did not see their fathers manhoodThen Noah awaking from the wine when he had learned what his younger son had done to himhe said Cursed be Canaan a servant of servants will he be to his brothersAnd he said Blessed be the Lord God of Shem let Canaan be his servantMay God enlarge Japheth and may he live in the tents of Shem and let Canaan be his servantAnd after the great flood Noah lived for three hundred and fifty yearsAnd all his days were completed in nine hundred and fifty years and then he diedThese are the generations of the sons of Noah Shem Ham and Japheth and of the sons who were born to them after the great floodThe sons of Japheth were Gomer and Magog and Madai and Javan and Tubal and Meshech and TirasAnd then the sons of Gomer were Ashkenaz and Riphath and TogarmahAnd the sons of Javan were Elishah and Tarshish Kittim and RodanimThe islands of the Gentiles were divided by these into their regions each one according to his tongue and their families in their nationsAnd the Sons of Ham were Cush and Mizraim and Put and CanaanAnd the sons of Cush were Seba and Havilah and Sabtah and Raamah and Sabteca The sons of Raamah were Sheba and DadanAnd then Cush conceived Nimrod he began to be powerful on the earthAnd he was an able hunter before the Lord From this a proverb came forth Just like Nimrod an able hunter before the LordAnd so the beginning of his kingdom was Babylon and Erech and Accad and Chalanne in the land of ShinarFrom that land Assur came forth and he built Nineveh and the streets of the city and Calahand also Resen between Nineveh and Calah This is a great cityAnd truly Mizraim conceived Ludim and Anamim and Lehabim Naphtuhimand Pathrusim and Casluhim from whom came forth the Philistines and the CaphtorimThen Canaan conceived Sidon his firstborn the Hittiteand the Jebusite and the Amorite the Girgashitethe Hivite and the Arkite the Siniteand the Arvadian the Samarite and the Hamathite And after this the peoples of the Canaanites became widespreadAnd the borders of Canaan went as one travels from Sidon to Gerar even to Gaza until one enters Sodom and Gomorrah and from Admah and Zeboiim even to LesaThese are the sons of Ham in their kindred and tongues and generations and lands and nationsLikewise from Shem the father of all the sons of Heber the elder brother of Japheth sons were bornThe sons of Shem were Elam and Asshur and Arphaxad and Lud and AramThe sons of Aram were Uz and Hul and Gether and MashBut truly Arphaxad conceived Shelah from whom was born EberAnd to Eber were born two sons the name of the one was Peleg for in his days the earth became divided and his brothers name was JoktanThis Joktan conceived Almodad and Sheleph and Hazarmaveth Jerahand Hadoram and Uzal and Diklahand Obal and Abimael Shebaand Ophir and Havilah and Jobab All these were the sons of JoktanAnd their habitation extended from Messa as one sojourns even to Sephar a mountain in the eastThese are the sons of Shem according to their kindred and tongues and the regions within their nationsThese are the families of Noah according to their peoples and nations The nations became divided according to these on the earth after the great floodNow the earth was of one language and of the same speechAnd when they were advancing from the east they found a plain in the land of Shinar and they dwelt in itAnd each one said to his neighbor Come let us make bricks and bake them with fire And they had bricks instead of stones and pitch instead of mortarAnd they said Come let us make a city and a tower so that its height may reach to heaven And let us make our name famous before we are divided into all the landsThen the Lord descended to see the city and the tower which the sons of Adam were buildingAnd he said Behold the people are united and all have one tongue And since they have begun to do this they will not desist from their plans until they have completed their workTherefore come let us descend and in that place confound their tongue so that they may not listen each one to the voice of his neighborAnd so the Lord divided them from that place into all the lands and they ceased to build the cityAnd for this reason its name was called Babel because in that place the language of the whole earth became confused And from then on the Lord scattered them across the face of every regionThese are the generations of Shem Shem was one hundred years old when he conceived Arphaxad two years after the great floodAnd after he conceived Arphaxad Shem lived for five hundred years and he conceived sons and daughtersNext Arphaxad lived for thirty-five years and then he conceived ShelahAnd after he conceived Shelah Arphaxad lived for three hundred and three years and he conceived sons and daughtersLikewise Shelah lived for thirty years and then he conceived EberAnd after he conceived Eber Shelah lived for four hundred and three years and he conceived sons and daughtersThen Eber lived for thirty-four years and he conceived PelegAnd after he conceived Peleg Eber lived for four hundred and thirty years and he conceived sons and daughtersLikewise Peleg lived for thirty years and then he conceived ReuAnd after he conceived Reu Peleg lived for two hundred and nine years and he conceived sons and daughtersThen Reu lived for thirty-two years and then he conceived SerugLikewise after he conceived Serug Reu lived for two hundred and seven years and he conceived sons and daughtersIn truth Serug lived for thirty years and then he conceived NahorAnd after he conceived Nahor Serug lived for two hundred years and he conceived sons and daughtersAnd so Nahor lived for twenty-nine years and then he conceived TerahAnd after he conceived Terah Nahor lived for one hundred and nineteen years and he conceived sons and daughtersAnd Terah lived for seventy years and then he conceived Abram and Nahor and HaranAnd these are the generations of Terah Terah conceived Abram Nahor and Haran Next Haran conceived LotAnd Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity in Ur of the ChaldeansThen Abram and Nahor took wives The name of Abrams wife was Sarai And the name of Nahors wife was Milcah the daughter of Haran the father of Milcah and the father of IscahBut Sarai was barren and had no childrenAnd so Terah took his son Abram and his grandson Lot the son of Haran and his daughter-in-law Sarai the wife of his son Abram and he led them away from Ur of the Chaldeans to go into the land of Canaan And they approached as far as Haran and they dwelt thereAnd the days of Terah that passed were two hundred and five years and then he died in HaranThen the Lord said to Abram Depart from your land and from your kindred and from your fathers house and come into the land that I will show youAnd I will make of you a great nation and I will bless you and magnify your name and you will be blessedI will bless those who bless you and curse those who curse you and in you all the families of the earth will be blessedAnd so Abram departed just as the Lord had instructed him and Lot went with him Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed from HaranAnd he took his wife Sarai and Lot the son of his brother and all the substance which they had come to possess and the lives which they had acquired in Haran and they departed in order to go to the land of Canaan And when they arrived in itAbram passed through the land even to the place of Shechem as far as the famous steep valley Now at that time the Canaanite was in the landThen the Lord appeared to Abram and he said to him To your offspring I will give this land And there he built an altar to the Lord who had appeared to himAnd passing on from there to a mountain which was opposite the east of Bethel he pitched his tent there having Bethel to the west and Hai on the east He also built an altar there to the Lord and he called upon his nameAnd Abram traveled going out and continuing further on toward the southBut a famine occurred in the land And Abram descended to Egypt to sojourn there For famine prevailed over the landAnd when he was close to entering Egypt he said to his wife Sarai I know you to be a beautiful womanAnd when the Egyptians see you they will say She is his wife And they will put me to death and retain youTherefore I beg you to say that you are my sister so that it may be well with me because of you and so that my soul may live by your favorAnd so when Abram had arrived in Egypt the Egyptians saw that the woman was exceedingly beautifulAnd the princes reported it to Pharaoh and they praised her to him And the woman was inducted into the house of PharaohIn truth they treated Abram well because of her And he had sheep and oxen and male donkeys and men servants and women servants and female donkeys and camelsBut the Lord scourged Pharaoh and his house with great wounds because of Sarai the wife of AbramAnd Pharaoh called Abram and he said to him What is this that you have done to me Why did you not tell me she was your wifeFor what reason did you claim her to be your sister so that I would take her to me as a wife Now therefore behold your mate receive her and goAnd Pharaoh instructed his men about Abram And they led him away with his wife and all that he hadTherefore Abram ascended from Egypt he and his wife and all that he had and Lot with him toward the southern regionBut he was very wealthy by the possession of gold and silverAnd he returned by the way that he came from the meridian into Bethel all the way to the place where before he had pitched his tent between Bethel and HaiThere at the place of the altar he had made before he again called upon the name of the LordBut Lot also who was with Abram had flocks of sheep and cattle and tentsNeither was the land able to contain them so that they might dwell together Indeed their substance was so great that they could not live in commonAnd then there also arose a conflict between the shepherds of Abram and of Lot Now at that time the Canaanite and the Perizzite lived in that landTherefore Abram said to Lot I ask you let there be no quarrel between me and you and between my shepherds and your shepherds For we are brothersBehold the entire land is before your eyes Withdraw from me I beg you If you will go to the left I will take the right If you choose the right I will pass to the leftAnd so Lot lifting up his eyes saw all the region around the Jordan which was thoroughly irrigated before the Lord overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah It was like the Paradise of the Lord and it was like Egypt approaching toward ZoarAnd Lot chose for himself the region around the Jordan and he withdrew by way of the east And they were divided one brother from the otherAbram dwelt in the land of Canaan In truth Lot stayed in the towns that were around the Jordan and he lived in SodomBut the men of Sodom were very wicked and they were sinners before the Lord beyond measureAnd the Lord said to Abram after Lot was divided from him Lift up your eyes and gaze out from the place where you are now to the north and to the meridian to the east and to the westAll the land that you see I will give to you and to your offspring even foreverAnd I will make your offspring like the dust of the earth If any man is able to number the dust of the earth he will be able to number your offspring as wellArise and walk through the land in its length and breadth For I will give it to youTherefore moving his tent Abram went and dwelt by the steep valley of Mamre which is in Hebron And he built an altar there to the LordNow it happened in that time that Amraphel king of Shinar and Arioch king of Pontus and Chedorlaomer king of the Elamites and Tidal king of the Nationswent to war against Bera king of Sodom and against Birsha king of Gomorrah and against Shinab king of Admah and against Shemeber king of Zeboiim and against the king of Bela that is ZoarAll these came together in the wooded valley which is now the Sea of SaltFor they had served Chedorlaomer for twelve years and in the thirteenth year they withdrew from himTherefore in the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer arrived and the kings who were with him And they struck the Rephaim at Ashteroth of the two horns and the Zuzim with them and the Emim at Shaveh-Kiriathaimand the Chorreans in the mountains of Seir even to the plains of Paran which is in the wildernessAnd they returned and arrived at the fountain of Mishpat which is Kadesh And they struck the entire region of the Amalekites and the Amorites who dwelt in HazazontamarAnd the king of Sodom and the king of Gomorrah and the king of Admah and the king of Zeboiim and indeed the king of Bela which is Zoar went forth And they directed their point against them in the wooded valleynamely against Chedorlaomer king of the Elamites and Tidal king of the Nations and Amraphel king of Shinar and Arioch king of Pontus four kings against fiveNow the wooded valley had many pits of bitumen And so the king of Sodom and the king of Gomorrah turned back and they fell there And those who remained fled to the mountainThen they took all the substance of the Sodomites and the Gomorrhites and all that pertained to food and they went awayalong with both Lot the son of Abrams brother who lived in Sodom and his substanceAnd behold one who had escaped reported it to Abram the Hebrew who lived in the steep valley of Mamre the Amorite who was the brother of Eshcol and the brother of Aner For these had formed an agreement with AbramWhen Abram had heard this namely that his brother Lot had been taken captive he numbered three hundred and eighteen of his own armed men and he went in pursuit all the way to DanAnd dividing his company he rushed upon them in the night And he struck them and pursued them as far as Hobah which is on the left hand of DamascusAnd he brought back all the substance and Lot his brother with his substance likewise the women and the peopleThen the king of Sodom went out to meet him after he returned from the slaughter at Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him at the valley of Shaveh which is the valley of the kingThen in truth Melchizedek the king of Salem brought forth bread and wine for he was a priest of the Most High Godhe blessed him and he said Blessed be Abram by the Most High God who created heaven and earthAnd blessed be the Most High God through whose protection the enemies are in your hands And he gave him tithes from everythingThen the king of Sodom said to Abram Give me these souls and take the rest for yourselfAnd he responded to him I lift up my hand to the Lord God the Most High the Possessor of heaven and earththat from one thread within a blanket even to a single shoelace I will not take anything from that which is yours lest you say I have enriched Abramexcept that which the young men have eaten and the shares for the men who came with me Aner Eshcol and Mamre These will take their sharesAnd so these things having been transacted the word of the Lord came to Abram by a vision saying Do not be afraid Abram I am your protector and your reward is exceedingly greatAnd Abram said Lord God what will you give to me I may go without children And the son of the steward of my house is this Eliezer of DamascusAnd Abram added Yet to me you have not given offspring And behold my servant born in my house will be my heirAnd immediately the word of the Lord came to him saying This one will not be your heir But he who will come from your loins the same will you have for your heirAnd he brought him outside and he said to him Take in the heavens and number the stars if you can And he said to him So also will your offspring beAbram believed God and it was reputed to him unto justiceAnd he said to him I am the Lord who led you away from Ur of the Chaldeans so as to give you this land and so that you would possess itBut he said Lord God in what way may I be able to know that I will possess itAnd the Lord responded by saying Take for me a cow of three years and a she-goat of three years and a ram of three years also a turtle-dove and a pigeonTaking all these he divided them through the middle and placed both parts opposite one another But the birds he did not divideAnd birds descended upon the carcasses but Abram drove them awayAnd when the sun was setting a deep sleep fell upon Abram and a dread great and dark invaded himAnd it was said to him Know beforehand that your future offspring will be sojourners in a land not their own and they will subjugate them in servitude and afflict them for four hundred yearsYet truly I will judge the nation that they will serve and after this they will depart with great substanceBut you will go to your fathers in peace and be buried at a good old ageBut in the fourth generation they will return here For the iniquities of the Amorites are not yet completed even to this present timeThen when the sun had set there came a dark mist and there appeared a smoking furnace and a lamp of fire passing between those divisionsOn that day God formed a covenant with Abram saying To your offspring I will give this land from the river of Egypt even to the great river Euphratesthe land of the Kenites and the Kenizzites the Kadmonitesand the Hittites and the Perizzites likewise the Rephaimand the Amorites and the Canaanites and the Girgashites and the JebusitesNow Sarai the wife of Abram had not conceived children But having an Egyptian handmaid named Hagarshe said to her husband Behold the Lord has closed me lest I give birth Enter to my handmaid so that perhaps I may receive sons of her at least And when he agreed to her supplicationshe took Hagar the Egyptian her handmaid ten years after they began to live in the land of Canaan and she gave her to her husband as a wifeAnd he entered to her But when she saw that she had conceived she despised her mistressAnd Sarai said to Abram You have acted unfairly against me I gave my handmaid into your bosom who when she saw that she had conceived held me in contempt May the Lord judge between me and youAbram responded to her by saying Behold your handmaid is in your hand to treat as it pleases you And so when Sarai afflicted her she took flightAnd when the Angel of the Lord had found her near the fountain of water in the wilderness which is on the way to Shur in the deserthe said to her Hagar handmaid of Sarai where have you come from And where will you go And she answered I flee from the face of Sarai my mistressAnd the Angel of the Lord said to her Return to your mistress and humble yourself under her handAnd again he said I will multiply your offspring continuously and they will not be numbered because of their multitudeBut thereafter he said Behold you have conceived and you will give birth to a son And you shall call his name Ishmael because the Lord has heard your afflictionHe will be a wild man His hand will be against all and all hands will be against him And he will pitch his tents away from the region of all his brothersThen she called upon the name of the Lord who had spoken to her You are the God who has seen me For she said Certainly here I have seen the back of the one who sees meBecause of this she called that well The well of the one who lives and who sees me The same is between Kadesh and BeredAnd Hagar gave birth to a son for Abram who called his name IshmaelAbram was eighty-six years old when Hagar gave birth to Ishmael for himIn truth after he began to be ninety-nine years of age the Lord appeared to him And he said to him I am the Almighty God Walk in my sight and become completeAnd I will set my covenant between me and you And I will multiply you very exceedinglyAbram fell prone on his faceAnd God said to him I AM and my covenant is with you and you will be the father of many nationsNo longer will your name be called Abram But you will be called Abraham for I have established you as the father of many nationsAnd I will cause you to increase very greatly and I will set you among the nations and kings will come forth from youAnd I will establish my covenant between me and you and with your offspring after you in their generations by a perpetual covenant to be God to you and to your offspring after youAnd I will give to you and to your offspring the land of your sojourn all the land of Canaan as an eternal possession and I will be their GodAgain God said to Abraham And you therefore shall keep my covenant and your offspring after you in their generationsThis is my covenant which you shall observe between me and you and your offspring after you All the males among you shall be circumcisedAnd you shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin so that it may be a sign of the covenant between me and youAn infant of eight days will be circumcised among you every male in your generations So also servants born to you as well as those bought shall be circumcised even those who are not of your stockAnd my covenant shall be with your flesh as an eternal covenantThe male the flesh of whose foreskin will not be circumcised that soul shall be eliminated from his people For he has made my covenant voidGod said also to Abraham Your wife Sarai you shall not call Sarai but SarahAnd I will bless her and from her I will give you a son whom I will bless and he will be among the nations and the kings of the peoples will rise from himAbraham fell on his face and he laughed saying in his heart Do you think a son can be born to a one hundred year old man And will Sarah give birth at the age of ninetyAnd he said to God If only Ishmael would live in your sightAnd God said to Abraham Your wife Sarah shall give birth to a son and you shall call his name Isaac and I will establish my covenant with him as a perpetual covenant and with his offspring after himLikewise concerning Ishmael I have heard you Behold I will bless and enlarge him and I will multiply him greatly He will produce twelve leaders and I will make him into a great nationYet in truth I will establish my covenant with Isaac to whom Sarah will give birth for you at this time next yearAnd when he had finished speaking with him God ascended from AbrahamThen Abraham took his son Ishmael and all who were born in his house and all whom he had bought every male among the men of his house and he circumcised the flesh of their foreskin promptly the very same day just as God had instructed himAbraham was ninety-nine years old when he circumcised the flesh of his foreskinAnd his son Ishmael had completed thirteen years at the time of his circumcisionOn the very same day Abraham was circumcised with his son IshmaelAnd all the men of his house those born in his house as well as those who were bought even the foreigners were circumcised with himThen the Lord appeared to him in the steep valley of Mamre when he was sitting at the door of his tent in the very heat of the dayAnd when he had lifted up his eyes there appeared to him three men standing near him When he had seen them he ran to meet them from the door of his tent and he reverenced them on the groundAnd he said If I O lord have found grace in your eyes do not pass by your servantBut I will bring a little water and you may wash your feet and rest under the treeAnd I will set out a meal of bread so that you may strengthen your heart after this you will pass on It is for this reason that you have turned aside to your servant And they said Do as you have spokenAbraham hurried into the tent to Sarah and he said to her Quickly mix together three measures of the finest wheat flour and make loaves baked under the ashesIn truth he himself ran to the herd and he took a calf from there very tender and very good and he gave it to a servant who hurried and boiled itLikewise he took butter and milk and the calf which he had boiled and he placed it before them Yet truly he himself stood near them under the treeAnd when they had eaten they said to him Where is Sarah your wife He answered Behold she is in the tentAnd he said to him When returning I will come to you at this time with life as a companion and your wife Sarah will have a son Hearing this Sarah laughed behind the door of the tentNow they were both old and in an advanced state of life and it had ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of womenAnd she laughed secretly saying After I have grown old and my lord is elderly shall I give myself to the work of delightThen the Lord said to Abraham Why did Sarah laugh saying How can I an old woman actually give birthIs anything difficult for God According to the announcement he will return to you at this same time with life as a companion and Sarah will have a sonSarah denied it saying I did not laugh For she was terribly afraid But the Lord said It is not so for you did laughTherefore when the men had risen up from there they directed their eyes against Sodom And Abraham traveled with them leading themAnd the Lord said How could I hide what I am about to do from Abrahamsince he will become a great and very robust nation and in him all the nations of the earth will be blessedFor I know that he will instruct his sons and his household after him to keep to the way of the Lord and to act with judgment and justice so that for the sake of Abraham the Lord may bring about all the things that he has spoken to himAnd so the Lord said The outcry from Sodom and Gomorrah has been multiplied and their sin has become exceedingly grievousI will descend and see whether they have fulfilled the work of the outcry that has reached me or whether it is not so in order that I may knowAnd they turned themselves from there and they went toward Sodom Yet in truth Abraham still stood in the sight of the LordAnd as they drew near he said Will you destroy the just with the impiousIf there were fifty of the just in the city will they perish with the rest And will you not spare that place for the sake of fifty of the just if they were in itFar be it from you to do this thing and to kill the just with the impious and for the just to be treated like the impious No this is not like you You judge all the earth you would never make such a judgmentAnd the Lord said to him If I find in Sodom fifty of the just in the midst of the city I will release the entire place because of themAnd Abraham responded by saying Since now I have begun I will speak to my Lord though I am dust and ashesWhat if there were five less than fifty of the just Would you despite the forty-five eliminate the entire city And he said I will not eliminate it if I find forty-five thereAnd again he said to him But if forty were found there what would you do He said I will not strike for the sake of the fortyI ask you he said not to be angry Lord if I speak What if thirty were found there He responded I will not act if I find thirty thereSince now I have begun he said I will speak to my Lord What if twenty were found there He said I will not put to death for the sake of the twentyI beg you he said not to be angry Lord if I speak yet once more What if ten were found there And he said I will not destroy it for the sake of the tenAnd the Lord departed after he had ceased speaking to Abraham who then returned to his placeAnd the two Angels arrived at Sodom in the evening and Lot was sitting at the gate of the city And when he had seen them he rose up and went to meet them And he reverenced prone on the groundAnd he said I beg you my lords turn aside to the house of your servant and lodge there Wash your feet and in the morning you will advance on your way And they said Not at all But we will lodge in the streetHe pressed them very much to turn aside to him And when they had entered his house he made a feast for them and he cooked unleavened bread and they ateBut before they went to bed the men of the city surrounded the house from boys to old men all the people togetherAnd they called out to Lot and they said to him Where are the men who entered to you in the night Bring them out here so that we may know themLot went out to them and blocking the door behind him he saidDo not I ask you my brothers do not be willing to commit this evilI have two daughters who as yet have not known man I will bring them out to you abuse them as it pleases you provided that you do no evil to these men because they have entered under the shadow of my roofBut they said Move away from there And again You have entered they said as a stranger should you then judge Therefore we will afflict you yourself more than them And they acted very violently against Lot And they were now at the point of breaking open the doorsAnd behold the men put out their hand and they pulled Lot in to them and they closed the doorAnd they struck those who were outside with blindness from the least to the greatest so that they were not able to find the doorThen they said to Lot Do you have here anyone of yours All who are yours sons-in-law or sons or daughters bring them out of this cityFor we will eliminate this place because the outcry among them has increased before the Lord who sent us to destroy themAnd so Lot going out spoke to his sons-in-law who were going to receive his daughters and he said Rise up Depart from this place For the Lord will destroy this city And it seemed to them that he was speaking playfullyAnd when it was morning the Angels compelled him saying Arise take your wife and the two daughters that you have lest you also should perish amid the wickedness of the cityAnd since he ignored them they took his hand and the hand of his wife as well as that of his two daughters because the Lord was sparing himAnd they brought him out and placed him beyond the city And there they spoke to him saying Save your life Do not look back Neither should you stay in the entire surrounding region But save yourself in the mountain lest you also should perishAnd Lot said to them I beg you my lordthough your servant has found grace before you and you have magnified your mercy which you have shown to me in saving my life I cannot be saved on the mountain lest perhaps some misfortune take hold of me and I dieThere is a certain city nearby to which I can flee it is a little one and I will be saved in it Is it not a modest one and will not my soul liveAnd he said to him Behold even now I have heard your petitions about this not to overturn the city on behalf of which you have spokenHurry and be saved there For I cannot do anything until you enter there For this reason the name of that city is called ZoarThe sun had risen over the land and Lot had entered into ZoarTherefore the Lord rained upon Sodom and Gomorrah sulphur and fire from the Lord out of heavenAnd he overturned these cities and all the surrounding region all the inhabitants of the cities and everything that springs from the landAnd his wife looking behind herself was turned into a statue of saltThen Abraham rising up in the morning in the place where he had stood before with the Lordlooked out toward Sodom and Gomorrah and the entire land of that region And he saw embers rising up from the land like smoke from a furnaceFor when God overthrew the cities of that region remembering Abraham he freed Lot from the overthrow of the cities in which he had dweltAnd Lot ascended from Zoar and he stayed on the mountain and likewise his two daughters with him for he was afraid to stay in Zoar and he dwelt in a cave he and his two daughters with himAnd the elder said to the younger Our father is old and no man remains in the land who can enter to us according to the custom of the whole worldCome let us inebriate him with wine and let us sleep with him so that we may be able to preserve offspring from our fatherAnd so they gave their father wine to drink that night And the elder went in and she slept with her father But he did not perceive it neither when his daughter lay down nor when she rose upLikewise the next day the elder said to the younger Behold yesterday I slept with my father let us give him wine to drink yet again this night and you will sleep with him so that we may save offspring from our fatherAnd then they gave their father wine to drink that night also and the younger daughter went in and slept with him And not even then did he perceive when she lay down or when she rose upTherefore the two daughters of Lot conceived by their fatherAnd the elder gave birth to a son and she called his name Moab He is the father of the Moabites even to the present dayLikewise the younger gave birth to a son and she called his name Ammon that is the son of my people He is the father of the Ammonites even todayAbraham advanced from there into the southern land and he lived between Kadesh and Shur And he sojourned in GerarAnd he said about his wife Sarah She is my sister Therefore Abimelech the king of Gerar sent for her and took herThen God came to Abimelech through a dream in the night and he said to him Lo you shall die because of the woman that you have taken For she has a husbandIn truth Abimelech had not touched her and so he said Lord would you put to death a people ignorant and justDid he not say to me She is my sister and did she not say He is my brother In the sincerity of my heart and the purity of my hands I have done thisAnd God said to him And I know that you have acted with a sincere heart And therefore I kept you from sinning against me and I did not release you to touch herNow therefore return his wife to the man for he is a prophet And he will pray for you and you will live But if you are not willing to return her know this you shall die a death you and all that is yoursAnd immediately Abimelech rising up in the night called all his servants And he spoke all these words in their hearing and all the men were very afraidThen Abimelech called also for Abraham and he said to him What have you done to us How have we sinned against you so that you would bring so great a sin upon me and upon my kingdom You have done to us what you ought not to have doneAnd remonstrating him again he said What did you see so that you would do thisAbraham responded I thought to myself saying Perhaps there is no fear of God in this place And they will put me to death because of my wifeYet in another way she is also truly my sister the daughter of my father and not the daughter of my mother and I took her as a wifeThen after God led me out of my fathers house I said to her You will show this mercy to me In every place to which we will travel you will say that I am your brother Therefore Abimelech took sheep and oxen and men servants and women servants and he gave them to Abraham And he returned his wife Sarah to himAnd he said The land is in your sight Dwell wherever it will please youThen to Sarah he said Behold I have given your brother one thousand silver coins This will be for you as a veil for your eyes to all who are with you and wherever you will travel And so remember that you were takenThen when Abraham prayed God healed Abimelech and his wife and his handmaids and they gave birthFor the Lord had closed every womb of the house of Abimelech because of Sarah the wife of AbrahamThen the Lord visited Sarah just as he had promised and he fulfilled what he had spokenAnd she conceived and gave birth to a son in her old age at the time that God had foretold to herAnd Abraham called the name of his son whom Sarah bore for him IsaacAnd he circumcised him on the eighth day just as God had instructed himwhen he was one hundred years old Indeed at this stage of his fathers life Isaac was bornAnd Sarah said God has brought laughter to me Whoever will hear of it will laugh with meAnd again she said Hearing this who would believe Abraham that Sarah breast-fed a son to whom she gave birth despite being elderlyAnd the boy grew and was weaned And Abraham made a great feast on the day of his weaningAnd when Sarah had seen the son of Hagar the Egyptian playing with her son Isaac she said to AbrahamCast out this woman servant and her son For the son of a woman servant will not be heir with my son IsaacAbraham took this grievously for the sake of his sonAnd God said to him Let it not seem harsh to you concerning the boy and your woman servant In all that Sarah has said to you listen to her voice For your offspring will be invoked in IsaacYet I will also make the son of the woman servant into a great nation for he is your offspringAnd so Abraham arose in the morning and taking bread and a skin of water he placed it upon her shoulder and he handed over the boy and he released her And when she had departed she wandered in the wilderness of BeershebaAnd when the water in the skin had been consumed she set aside the boy under one of the trees that were thereAnd she moved away and sat in a distant area as far as a bow can reach For she said I shall not see the boy die And so sitting opposite her he lifted up his voice and weptBut God heard the voice of the boy And an Angel of God called to Hagar from heaven saying What are you doing Hagar Do not be afraid For God has heeded the voice of the boy from the place where he isRise up Take the boy and hold him by the hand For I will make of him a great nationAnd God opened her eyes And seeing a well of water she went and filled the skin and she gave the boy to drinkAnd God was with him And he grew and he stayed in the wilderness and he became a young man an archerAnd he lived in the desert of Paran and his mother took a wife for him from the land of EgyptAt the same time Abimelech and Phicol the leader of his army said to Abraham God is with you in everything that you doTherefore swear by God that you will do no harm to me and to my posterity and to my stock But according to the mercy that I have done to you you will do to me and to the land to which you have turned as a newcomerAnd Abraham said I will swearAnd he reproved Abimelech because of a well of water which his servants had taken away by forceAnd Abimelech responded I do not know who did this thing but you also did not reveal it to me nor have I heard of it before todayAnd so Abraham took sheep and oxen and he gave them to Abimelech And both of them struck a pactAnd Abraham set aside seven female lambs from the flockAbimelech said to him What purpose have these seven female lambs which you have caused to stand separatelyBut he said You will receive seven female lambs from my hand so that they may be a testimony for me that I dug this wellFor this reason that place was called Beersheba because there both of them did swearAnd they initiated a pact on behalf of the well of oathThen Abimelech and Phicol the leader of his army rose up and they returned to the land of the Palestinians In truth Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba and there he called upon the name of the Lord God EternalAnd he was a settler in the land of the Palestinians for many daysAfter these things occurred God tested Abraham and he said to him Abraham Abraham And he answered Here I amHe said to him Take your only begotten son Isaac whom you love and go into the land of vision And there you shall offer him as a holocaust upon one of the mountains which I will show to youAnd so Abraham getting up in the night harnessed his donkey taking with him two youths and his son Isaac And when he had cut wood for the holocaust he traveled toward the place as God had instructed himThen on the third day lifting up his eyes he saw the place at a distanceAnd he said to his servants Wait here with the donkey I and the boy will hurry further ahead to that place After we have worshipped will return to youHe also took the wood for the holocaust and he imposed it upon his son Isaac And he himself carried in his hands fire and a sword And as the two continued on togetherIsaac said to his father My father And he answered What do you want son Behold he said fire and wood Where is the victim for the holocaustBut Abraham said God himself will provide the victim for the holocaust my son Thus they continued on togetherAnd they came to the place that God had shown to him There he built an altar and he set the wood in order upon it And when he had bound his son Isaac he laid him on the altar upon the pile of woodAnd he reached out his hand and took hold of the sword in order to sacrifice his sonAnd behold an Angel of the Lord called out from heaven saying Abraham Abraham And he answered Here I amAnd he said to him Do not extend your hand over the boy and do not do anything to him Now I know that you fear God since you have not spared your only begotten son for my sakeAbraham lifted up his eyes and he saw behind his back a ram among the thorns caught by the horns which he took and offered as a holocaust instead of his sonAnd he called the name of that place The Lord Sees Thus even to this day it is said On the mountain the Lord will seeThen the Angel of the Lord called out to Abraham a second time from heaven sayingBy my own self I have sworn says the Lord Because you have done this thing and have not spared your only begotten son for my sakeI will bless you and I will multiply your offspring like the stars of heaven and like the sand which is on the seashore Your offspring will possess the gates of their enemiesAnd in your offspring all the nations of the earth will be blessed because you obeyed my voiceAbraham returned to his servants and they went to Beersheba together and he lived thereAfter these things occurred it was reported to Abraham that Milcah likewise had borne sons for his brother NahorUz the firstborn and Buz his brother and Kemuel the father of the Syriansand Chesed and Hazo likewise Pildash and Jidlaphas well as Bethuel of whom was born Rebekah These eight Milcah bore for Nahor the brother of AbrahamIn truth his concubine named Reumah bore Tebah and Gaham and Tahash and MaacahNow Sarah lived for one hundred and twenty-seven yearsAnd she died in the city of Arba which is Hebron in the land of Canaan And Abraham came to mourn and weep for herAnd when he had risen up from the funeral duties he spoke to the sons of Heth sayingI am a newcomer and a sojourner among you Give me the right of a sepulcher among you so that I may bury my deadThe sons of Heth responded by sayingHear us O lord you are a leader of God among us Bury your dead in our chosen sepulchers And no man shall be able to prohibit you from burying your dead within his memorialAbraham arose and he reverenced the people of the land namely the sons of HethAnd he said to them If it pleases your soul that I should bury my dead hear me and intercede on my behalf with Ephron the son of Zoharso that he may give me the double cave which he has at the far end of his field He may transfer it to me for as much money as it is worth in your sight for the possession of a sepulcherNow Ephron dwelt in the midst of the sons of Heth And Ephron responded to Abraham in the hearing of everyone who was entering at the gate of his city sayingLet it never be so my lord but you should pay greater heed to what I say The field I will transfer to you and the cave that is in it In the presence of the sons of my people bury your deadAbraham reverenced in the sight of the people of the landAnd he spoke to Ephron standing in the midst of the people I ask you to hear me I will give you money for the field Take it and so I will bury my dead in itAnd Ephron responded My lord hear meThe land that you request is worth four hundred shekels of silver This is the price between me and you But how much is this Bury your deadAnd when Abraham had heard this he weighed out the money that Ephron had requested in the hearing of the sons of Heth four hundred shekels of silver of the approved public currencyAnd having confirmed that the field in which there was a double cave overlooking Mamre formerly belonged to Ephron both it and the sepulcher and all its trees with all its surrounding limitsAbraham took it as a possession in the sight of the sons of Heth and of everyone who was entering at the gate of his citySo then Abraham buried his wife Sarah in the double cave of the field that overlooked Mamre This is Hebron in the land of CanaanAnd the field was confirmed to Abraham with the cave that was in it as a memorial possession before the sons of HethNow Abraham was old and of many days And the Lord had blessed him in all thingsAnd he said to the elder servant of his house who was in charge of all that he had Place your hand under my thighso that I may make you swear by the Lord the God of heaven and earth that you will not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I liveBut that you will proceed to my land and kindred and from there take a wife for my son IsaacThe servant responded If the woman is not willing to come with me into this land must I lead your son back to the place from which you departedAnd Abraham said Beware that you never lead my son back to that placeThe Lord God of heaven who took me from my fathers house and from the land of my nativity who spoke to me and swore to me saying To your offspring I will give this land himself will send his Angel before you and you will take from there a wife for my sonBut if the woman is not willing to follow you you will not be held by the oath Only do not lead my son back to that placeTherefore the servant placed his hand under the thigh of Abraham his lord and he swore to him on his wordAnd he took ten camels from his lords herd and he went forth carrying with him things from all of his goods And he set out and continued on to the city of Nahor in MesopotamiaAnd when he had made the camels lie down outside of the town near a well of water in the evening at the time when women are accustomed to go out to draw water he saidO Lord the God of my lord Abraham meet with me today I beg you and show mercy to my lord AbrahamBehold I stand near the fountain of water and the daughters of the inhabitants of this city will go forth to draw waterTherefore the girl to whom I will say Tip your pitcher so that I may drink and she will respond Drink In fact I will give your camels a drink also the same one is she whom you have prepared for your servant Isaac And by this I will understand that you have shown mercy to my lordBut he had not yet completed these words within himself when behold Rebekah went out the daughter of Bethuel son of Milcah the wife of Nahor the brother of Abraham having a pitcher on her shoulderShe was an exceedingly elegant girl and a most beautiful virgin and unknown by man And she descended to the spring and she filled her pitcher and then was returningAnd the servant ran to meet her and he said Provide me with a little water to drink from your pitcherAnd she responded Drink my lord And she quickly brought down the pitcher on her arm and she gave him a drinkAnd after he drank she added In fact I will draw water for your camels also until they all drinkAnd pouring out the pitcher into the troughs she ran back to the well to draw water and having drawn she gave it to all the camelsBut he was contemplating her silently wanting to know whether the Lord had caused his journey to prosper or notThen after the camels drank the man took out gold earrings weighing two shekels and the same number of bracelets ten shekels in weightAnd he said to her Whose daughter are you Tell me is there any place in your fathers house to lodgeShe responded I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah to whom she gave birth for NahorAnd she continued saying There is very much straw and hay with us and a spacious place to stayThe man bowed himself down and he adored the Lordsaying Blessed be the Lord the God of my lord Abraham who has not taken away his mercy and truth from my lord and who has led me on a direct journey to the house of the brother of my lordAnd so the girl ran and she reported all that she had heard in the house of her motherNow Rebekah had a brother named Laban who went out quickly to the man where the spring wasAnd when he had seen the earrings and bracelets in his sisters hands and he had heard all the words being repeated This is what the man spoke to me he came to the man who stood by the camels and near the spring of waterand he said to him Enter O blessed of the Lord Why do you stand outside I have prepared the house and a place for the camelsAnd he brought him into his guest quarters And he unharnessed the camels and he distributed straw and hay and water to wash his feet and that of the men who arrived with himAnd bread was set out in his sight But he said I will not eat until I have spoken my words He answered him SpeakThen he said I am the servant of AbrahamAnd the Lord has blessed my lord greatly and he has become great And he has given him sheep and oxen silver and gold men servants and women servants camels and donkeysAnd Sarah the wife of my lord has given birth to a son for my lord in her old age and he has given him all that he hadAnd my lord made me swear saying You shall not take a wife for my son from the Canaanites in whose land I dwellBut you shall travel to my fathers house and you shall take a wife of my own kindred for my sonBut truly I answered my lord What if the woman is not willing to come with meThe Lord he said in whose sight I walk will send his Angel with you and he will direct your way And you shall take a wife for my son from my own kindred and from my fathers houseBut you will be innocent of my curse if when you will arrive at my close relatives they will not grant this to youAnd so today I arrived at the well of water and I said O Lord the God of my lord Abraham if you have directed my way in which I now walkbehold I stand next to the well of water and the virgin who will go forth to draw water will hear from me Give me a little water to drink from your pitcherAnd she will say to me You drink and I will also draw for your camels Let the same be the woman whom the Lord has prepared for the son of my lordAnd while I thought over these things silently within myself Rebekah appeared arriving with a pitcher which she carried on her shoulder And she descended to the spring and drew water And I said to her Give me a little to drinkAnd she quickly let down the pitcher from her arm and said to me You drink and to your camels I will also distribute drinking water I drank and she watered the camelsAnd I questioned her saying Whose daughter are you And she responded I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Nahor whom Milcah bore to him And so I hung the earrings on her to adorn her face and I put the bracelets on her handsAnd falling prostrate I adored the Lord blessing the Lord the God of my lord Abraham who has led me along the straight path so as to take the daughter of my lords brother to his sonFor this reason if you would act according to mercy and truth with my lord tell me so But if it pleases you otherwise say that to me also so that I may go either to the right or to the leftAnd Laban and Bethuel responded A word has proceeded from the Lord We are not able to speak anything else to you beyond what pleases himLo Rebekah is in your sight Take her and continue on and let her be the wife of the son of your lord just as the Lord has spokenWhen Abrahams servant had heard this falling down to the ground he adored the LordAnd bringing forth vessels of silver and gold as well as garments he gave them to Rebekah as a tribute Likewise he offered gifts to her brothers and her motherAnd a banquet began and they feasted and drank together and they lodged there And rising up in the morning the servant said Release me so that I may go to my lordAnd her brothers and mother responded Let the girl remain for at least ten days with us and after that she will continue onDo not be willing he said to delay me for the Lord has directed my way Release me so that I may journey to my lordAnd they said Let us call the girl and ask her willAnd when having been called she arrived they wanted to know Will you go with this man And she said I will goTherefore they released her and her nurse and the servant of Abraham and his companionswishing prosperity for their sister by saying You are our sister May you increase to thousands of thousands And may your offspring possess the gates of their enemiesAnd so Rebekah and her maids riding upon camels followed the man who quickly returned to his lordThen at the same time Isaac was walking along the way that leads to the well whose name is of the One who lives and who sees For he dwelt in the southern landAnd he had gone out to meditate in the field as daylight was now declining And when he had lifted up his eyes he saw camels advancing from afarLikewise Rebekah having seen Isaac descended from the camelAnd she said to the servant Who is that man who advances to meet us through the field And he said to her That is my lord And so quickly taking up her cloak she covered herselfThen the servant explained to Isaac all that he had doneAnd he led her into the tent of Sarah his mother and he accepted her as wife And he loved her so very much that it tempered the sorrow which befell him at his mothers deathIn truth Abraham took another wife named KeturahAnd she bore to him Zimran and Jokshan and Medan and Midian and Ishbak and ShuahLikewise Jokshan conceived Sheba and Dedan The sons of Dedan were Asshurim and Letushim and LeummimAnd truly from Midian was born Ephah and Epher and Hanoch and Abida and Eldaah All these were the sons of KeturahAnd Abraham gave everything that he possessed to IsaacBut to the sons of the concubines he gave generous gifts and he separated them from his son Isaac while he still lived toward the eastern regionNow the days of Abrahams life were one hundred and seventy-five yearsAnd declining he died in a good old age and at an advanced stage of life and full of days And he was gathered to his peopleAnd his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the double cave which was situated in the field of Ephron of the son of Zohar the Hittite across from the region of Mamrewhich he had bought from the sons of Heth There he was buried with his wife SarahAnd after his passing God blessed his son Isaac who lived near the well named of the One who lives and who seesThese are the generations of Ishmael the son of Abraham whom Hagar the Egyptian Sarahs servant bore to himAnd these are the names of his sons according to their language and generations The firstborn of Ishmael was Nebaioth then Kedar and Adbeel and Mibsamlikewise Mishma and Dumah and MassaHadad and Tema and Jetur and Naphish and KedemahThese are the sons of Ishmael And these are their names throughout their fortresses and towns the twelve princes of their tribesAnd the years of the life of Ishmael that passed were one hundred and thirty-seven And declining he died and was placed with his peopleNow he had lived from Havilah as far as Shur which overlooks Egypt as it approaches the Assyrians He passed away in the sight of all his brothersLikewise these are the generations of Isaac the son of Abraham Abraham conceived Isaacwho when he was forty years old took Rebekah the sister of Laban the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian from Mesopotamia as a wifeAnd Isaac beseeched the Lord on behalf of his wife because she was barren And he heard him and he gave conception to RebekahBut the little ones struggled in her womb So she said If it was to be so with me what need was there to conceive And she went to consult the LordAnd responding he said Two nations are in your womb and two peoples will be divided out of your womb and one people will overcome the other people and the elder will serve the youngerNow the time had arrived to give birth and behold twins were discovered in her wombHe who departed first was red and entirely hairy like a pelt and his name was called Esau At once the other departed and he held his brothers foot in his hand and because of this he was called JacobIsaac was sixty years old when the little ones were born to himAnd as adults Esau became a knowledgeable hunter and a man of agriculture but Jacob a simple man dwelt in tentsIsaac was fond of Esau because he was fed from his hunting and Rebekah loved JacobThen Jacob boiled a small meal Esau when he had arrived weary from the fieldsaid to him Give me this red stew for I am very tired For this reason his name was called EdomJacob said to him Sell me your right of the firstbornHe answered Lo I am dying what will the right of the firstborn provide for meJacob said So then swear to me Esau swore to him and he sold his right of the firstbornAnd so taking bread and the food of lentils he ate and he drank and he went away giving little weight to having sold the right of the firstbornThen when a famine arose over the land after that barrenness which had happened in the days of Abraham Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Palestinians in GerarAnd the Lord appeared to him and he said Do not descend into Egypt but rest in the land that I will tell youand sojourn in it and I will be with you and I will bless you For to you and to your offspring I will give all these regions completing the oath that I promised to Abraham your fatherAnd I will multiply your offspring like the stars of heaven And I will give to your posterity all these regions And in your offspring all the nations of the earth will be blessedbecause Abraham obeyed my voice and kept my precepts and commandments and observed the ceremonies and the lawsAnd so Isaac remained in GerarAnd when he was questioned by the men of that place about his wife he answered She is my sister For he was afraid to confess her to be his mate thinking that perhaps they would put him to death because of her beautyAnd when very many days had passed and he had remained in the same place Abimelech king of the Palestinians gazing through a window saw him being playful with Rebekah his wifeAnd summoning him he said It is clear that she is your wife Why did you falsely claim her to be your sister He answered I was afraid lest I might die because of herAnd Abimelech said Why have you burdened us Someone from the people could have lain with your wife and you would have brought a great sin upon us And he instructed all the people sayingWhoever will touch the wife of this man will die a deathThen Isaac sowed in that land and he found in that same year one hundredfold And the Lord blessed himAnd the man was enriched and he continued prospering as well as increasing until he became very greatLikewise he had possessions of sheep and of herds and a very large family Because of this the Palestinians envied himso at that time they obstructed all the wells that the servants of his father Abraham had dug filling them with soilIt reached a point where Abimelech himself said to Isaac Move away from us for you have become very much more powerful than weAnd departing he then went toward the torrent of Gerar and he dwelt thereAgain he dug up other wells which the servants of his father Abraham had dug and which after his death the Philistines had formerly obstructed And he called them by the same names that his father had called them beforeAnd they dug in the torrent and they found living waterBut in that place also the shepherds of Gerar argued against the shepherds of Isaac by saying It is our water For this reason he called the name of the well because of what had happened CalumnyThen they dug up yet another one And over that one also they fought and he called it EnmityAdvancing from there he dug another well over which they did not contend And so he called its name Latitude saying Now the Lord has expanded us and caused us to increase across the landThen he ascended from that place into Beershebawhere the Lord appeared to him on the same night saying I am the God of Abraham your father Do not be afraid for I am with you I will bless you and I will multiply your offspring because of my servant AbrahamAnd so he built an altar there And he invoked the name of the Lord and he stretched out his tent And he instructed his servants to dig a wellWhen Abimelech and Ahuzzath his friend and Phicol the leader of the military had arrived from Gerar to that placeIsaac said to them Why have you come to me a man whom you hate and whom you have expelled from among youAnd they responded We saw that the Lord is with you and therefore we said Let there be an oath between us and let us initiate a pactso that you may not do us any kind of harm just as we have touched nothing of yours and have not caused any injury to you but with peace we released you augmented by the blessing of the LordTherefore he made them a feast and after the food and drinkarising in the morning they swore to one another And Isaac sent them away peacefully to their own placeThen behold on the same day the servants of Isaac came reporting to him about a well which they had dug and saying We have found waterTherefore he called it Abundance And the name of the city was established as Beersheba even to the present dayIn truth at forty years of age Esau took wives Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite and Basemath the daughter of Elon of the same placeAnd they both offended the mind of Isaac and RebekahNow Isaac was old and his eyes were cloudy and so he was not able to see And he called his elder son Esau and he said to him My son And he responded Here I amHis father said to him You see that I am old and I do not know the day of my deathTake your weapons the quiver and the bow and go out And when you have taken something by huntingmake from it a small meal for me just as you know I like and bring it so that I may eat and my soul may bless you before I dieAnd when Rebekah had heard this and he had gone out into the field to fulfill his fathers ordershe said to her son Jacob I heard your father speaking with your brother Esau and saying to himBring to me from your hunting and make me foods so that I may eat and bless you in the sight of the Lord before I dieTherefore now my son agree to my counseland go straight to the flock and bring me two of the best young goats so that from them I may make meat for your father such as he willingly eatsThen when you have brought these in and he has eaten he may bless you before he diesHe answered her You know that my brother Esau is a hairy man and I am smoothIf my father should lay hands on me and perceive it I am afraid lest he think me willing to mock him and I will bring a curse upon myself instead of a blessingAnd his mother said to him Let this curse be upon me my son Yet listen to my voice and go directly to bring what I saidHe went out and he brought and he gave to his mother She prepared the meats just as she knew his father likedAnd she clothed him with the very fine garments of Esau which she had at home with herAnd she encircled his hands with little pelts from the young goats and she covered his bare neckAnd she gave him the small meal and she handed him the bread that she had bakedWhen he had carried these in he said My father And he answered Im listening Who are you my sonAnd Jacob said I am Esau your firstborn I have done as you instructed me Arise sit and eat from my hunting so that your soul may bless meAnd again Isaac said to his son How were you able to find it so quickly my son He answered It was the will of God so that what I sought met with me quicklyAnd Isaac said Come here so that I may touch you my son and may prove whether you are my son Esau or notHe approached his father and when he had felt him Isaac said The voice indeed is the voice of Jacob But the hands are the hands of EsauAnd he did not recognize him because his hairy hands made him seem similar to the elder one Therefore blessing himhe said Are you my son Esau He answered I amThen he said Bring me the foods from your hunting my son so that my soul may bless you And when he had eaten what was offered he also brought forth wine for him And after he finished ithe said to him Come to me and give me a kiss my sonHe approached and kissed him And immediately he perceived the fragrance of his garments And so blessing him he said Behold the smell of my son is like the smell of a plentiful field which the Lord has blessedMay God give to you from the dew of heaven and from the fatness of the earth an abundance of grain and wineAnd may the peoples serve you and may the tribes reverence you May you be the lord of your brothers and may your mothers sons bow down before you Whoever curses you may he be cursed and whoever blesses you may he be filled with blessingsScarcely had Isaac completed his words and Jacob departed when Esau arrivedAnd he brought his father foods cooked from his hunting saying Arise my father and eat from your sons hunting so that your soul may bless meAnd Isaac said to him But who are you And he answered I am your firstborn son EsauIsaac became frightened and very astonished And wondering beyond what can be believed he said Then who is he that a while ago brought me the prey from his hunting from which I ate before you arrived And I blessed him and he will be blessedEsau having heard his fathers words roared out with a great outcry And being confounded he said But bless me also my fatherAnd he said Your twin came deceitfully and he received your blessingBut he responded Justly is his name called Jacob For he has supplanted me yet another time My birthright he took away before and now this second time he has stolen my blessing And again he said to his father Have you not reserved a blessing for me alsoIsaac answered I have appointed him as your lord and I have subjugated all his brothers as his servants I have reinforced him with grain and wine and after this my son what more shall I do for youAnd Esau said to him Have you only one blessing father I beg you bless me also And when he wept with a loud wailIsaac was moved and he said to him In the fatness of the earth and in the dew of heaven from abovewill your blessing be You will live by the sword and you will serve your brother But the time will arrive when you will shake off and release his yoke from your neckTherefore Esau always hated Jacob for the blessing with which his father had blessed him And he said in his heart The days will arrive for the mourning of my father and I will kill my brother JacobThese things were reported to Rebekah And sending and calling for her son Jacob she said to him Behold your brother Esau is threatening to kill youTherefore now my son listen to my voice Rise up and flee to my brother Laban in HaranAnd you will dwell with him for a few days until the fury of your brother subsidesand his indignation ceases and he forgets the things that you have done to him After this I will send for you and bring you from there to here Why should I be bereaved of both my sons in one dayAnd Rebekah said to Isaac I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth If Jacob accepts a wife from the stock of this land I would not be willing to liveAnd so Isaac called for Jacob and he blessed him and he instructed him saying Do not be willing to accept a mate from the family of CanaanBut go and journey to Mesopotamia of Syria to the house of Bethuel your mothers father and there accept for yourself a wife from the daughters of Laban your maternal uncleAnd may God almighty bless you and may he cause you to increase and also to multiply so that you may be influential among the peopleAnd may he give the blessings of Abraham to you and to your offspring after you so that you may possess the land of your sojourning which he promised to your grandfatherAnd when Isaac had dismissed him setting out he went to Mesopotamia of Syria to Laban the son of Bethuel the Syrian the brother to Rebekah his motherBut Esau seeing that his father had blessed Jacob and had sent him into Mesopotamia of Syria to take a wife from there and that after the blessing he had instructed him saying You shall not accept a wife from the daughters of Canaanand that Jacob obeying his parents had gone into Syriahaving evidence also that his father did not look with favor upon the daughters of Canaanhe went to Ishmael and he took as a wife beside those he had before Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abrahams son the sister of NebaiothMeanwhile Jacob having departed from Beersheba continued on to HaranAnd when he had arrived at a certain place where he would rest after the setting of the sun he took some of the stones that lay there and placing them under his head he slept in the same placeAnd he saw in his sleep a ladder standing upon the earth with its top touching heaven also the Angels of God ascending and descending by itand the Lord leaning upon the ladder saying to him I am the Lord the God of Abraham your father and the God of Isaac The land in which you sleep I will give to you and to your offspringAnd your offspring will be like the dust of the earth You will spread abroad to the West and to the East and to the North and to the Meridian And in you and in your offspring all the tribes of the earth shall be blessedAnd I will be your guardian wherever you will journey and I will bring you back into this land Neither will I dismiss you until I have accomplished all that I have saidAnd when Jacob had awakened from sleep he said Truly the Lord is in this place and I did not know itAnd being terrified he said How terrible this place is This is nothing other than the house of God and the gateway of heavenTherefore Jacob arising in the morning took the stone which he had placed under his head and he set it up as monument pouring oil over itAnd he called the name of the city Bethel which before was called LuzAnd then he made a vow saying If God will be with me and will guard me along the way by which I walk and will give me bread to eat and clothing to wearand if I will return prosperously to my fathers house then the Lord will be my Godand this stone which I have set up as a monument will be called the House of God And from all the things that you will give to me I will offer tithes to youAnd so Jacob setting out arrived in the eastern landAnd he saw a well in a field and also three flocks of sheep reclining near it For the animals were watered from it and its mouth was closed with a great stoneAnd the custom was when all the sheep were gathered together to roll away the stone And when the flocks had been refreshed they placed it over the mouth of the well againAnd he said to the shepherds Brothers where are you from And they answered From HaranAnd questioning them he said Do you know Laban the son of Nahor They said We know himHe said Is he well He is very well they said And behold his daughter Rachel approaches with his flockAnd Jacob said There is still much daylight remaining and it is not time to return the flocks to the sheepfold Give the sheep to drink first and then lead them back to pastureThey responded We cannot until all the animals are gathered together and we remove the stone from the mouth of the well so that we may water the flocksThey were still speaking and behold Rachel arrived with her fathers sheep for she pastured the flockWhen Jacob had seen her and he realized that she was his maternal first cousin and that these were the sheep of his uncle Laban he removed the stone which closed the wellAnd having watered the flock he kissed her And lifting up his voice he weptAnd he revealed to her that he was a brother of her father and the son of Rebekah And so hurrying she announced it to her fatherAnd when he had heard that Jacob his sisters son had arrived he ran to meet him And embracing him and kissing him heartily he brought him into his house But when he had heard the reasons for his journeyhe responded You are my bone and my flesh And after the days of one month were completedhe said to him Though you are my brother will you serve me for nothing Tell me what wages you would acceptIn truth he had two daughters the name of the elder was Leah and truly the younger was called RachelBut while Leah was bleary-eyed Rachel had an elegant appearance and was attractive to beholdAnd Jacob loving her said I will serve you for seven years for your younger daughter RachelLaban responded It is better that I give her to you than to another man remain with meTherefore Jacob served for seven years for Rachel And these seemed like only a few days because of the greatness of loveAnd he said to Laban Give my wife to me For now the time has been fulfilled so that I may go in to herAnd he having called a great crowd of his friends to the feast agreed to the marriageAnd at night he brought in his daughter Leah to himgiving his daughter a handmaid named Zilpah After Jacob had gone in to her according to custom when morning had arrived he saw LeahAnd he said to his father-in-law What is it that you intended to do Did I not serve you for Rachel Why have you deceived meLaban responded It is not the practice in this place to give the younger in marriage firstComplete a week of days with this mating And then I will give this one to you also for the service that you will provide to me for another seven yearsHe agreed to his pleading And after the week had passed he took Rachel as a wifeTo her the father had given Bilhah as her servantAnd having at last obtained the marriage he desired he preferred the love of the latter before the former and he served with him another seven yearsBut the Lord seeing that he despised Leah opened her womb but her sister remained barrenHaving conceived she gave birth to a son and she called his name Reuben saying The Lord saw my humiliation now my husband will love meAnd again she conceived and bore a son and she said Because the Lord heard that I was treated with contempt he has also given this one to me And she called his name SimeonAnd she conceived a third time and she gave birth to another son and she said Now likewise my husband will unite with me because I have borne him three sons And because of this she called his name LeviA fourth time she conceived and bore a son and she said Only now will I confess to the Lord And for this reason she called him Judah And she ceased from child-bearingThen Rachel discerning that she was infertile envied her sister and so she said to her husband Give me children otherwise I will dieJacob being angry responded to her Am I in the place of God who has deprived you of the fruit of your wombBut she said I have a handmaid Bilhah Go in to her so that she may give birth upon my knees and I may have sons by herAnd she gave him Bilhah in marriageAnd when her husband had gone in to her she conceived and bore a sonAnd Rachel said The Lord has judged for me and he has heeded my voice giving me a son And because of this she called his name DanAnd conceiving again Bilhah bore anotherabout whom Rachel said God has compared me with my sister and I have prevailed And she called him NaphtaliLeah perceiving that she had desisted from child-bearing delivered Zilpah her handmaid to her husbandAnd she after having borne a son with difficultysaid Happiness And for this reason she called his name GadLikewise Zilpah bore anotherAnd Leah said This one is for my happiness Indeed women will call me blessed Because of this she called him AsherThen Reuben going out into the field at the time of the wheat harvest found mandrakes These he brought to his mother Leah And Rachel said Give me a portion of your sons mandrakesShe responded Does it seem like such a small matter to you that you have usurped from me my husband unless you will also take my sons mandrakes Rachel said He will sleep with you this night because of your sons mandrakesAnd when Jacob returned from the field in the evening Leah went out to meet him and she said You will enter to me because I have hired you for the reward of my sons mandrakes And he slept with her that nightAnd God heard her prayers And she conceived and bore a fifth sonAnd she said God has given a reward to me because I gave my handmaid to my husband And she called his name IssacharConceiving again Leah bore a sixth sonAnd she said God has endowed me with a good dowry And now at this turn my husband will be with me because I have conceived six sons for him And therefore she called his name ZebulunAfter him she bore a daughter named DinahThe Lord likewise remembering Rachel heeded her and opened her wombAnd she conceived and bore a son saying God has taken away my reproachAnd she called his name Joseph saying The Lord has added to me another sonBut when Joseph was born Jacob said to his father-in-law Release me so that I may return to my native country and to my landGive me my wives and my children for whom I have served you so that I may depart You know the servitude with which I have served youLaban said to him May I find grace in your sight I have learned by experience that God has blessed me because of youChoose your wages which I will give youBut he responded You know how I have served you and how great your possession became in my handsYou had little before I came to you and now you have achieved riches And the Lord has blessed you since my arrival It is just therefore that at some time I also should provide for my own houseAnd Laban said What shall I give to you But he said I want nothing But if you will do what I ask I will feed and guard your sheep againGo around through all your flocks and separate all the sheep of variegated or spotted fleece and whatever will be darkened or blemished or variegated as much among the sheep as among the goats will be my wagesAnd my justice will answer on my behalf tomorrow when the time of settlement arrives before you And all that is not variegated or blemished or darkened as much among the sheep as among the goats these will prove me to be a thiefAnd Laban said I hold favor for this requestAnd on that day he separated the she-goats and the sheep and the he-goats and the rams with variegations or with blemishes But every one of the flock which was of one color that is of white or of black fleece he delivered into the hands of his sonsAnd he established a distance of three days journey between himself and his son-in-law who pastured the remainder of his flockThen Jacob taking green branches of poplar and almond and sycamore trees debarked them in part And when the bark was pulled off in the parts that were stripped there appeared whiteness yet the parts that were left whole remained green And so in this way the color was made variegatedAnd he placed them in the troughs where the water was poured out so that when the flocks had arrived to drink they would have the branches before their eyes and in their sight they might conceiveAnd it happened that in the very heat of joining together the sheep looked upon the branches and they bore the blemished and the variegated those speckled with diverse colorAnd Jacob divided the flock and he set the branches in the troughs before the eyes of the rams Now whatever was white or black belonged to Laban but in truth the others belonged to Jacob for the flocks were dispersed among one anotherTherefore when the first to arrive were climbing on the ewes Jacob placed the branches in the troughs of water before the eyes of the rams and the sheep so that they might conceive while they were gazing upon themYet when the late arrivals and the last to conceive were let in he did not place these And so those that arrived late became Labans and those that arrived first became JacobsAnd the man was enriched beyond limit and he had many flocks women servants and men servants camels and donkeysBut afterwards he heard the words of the sons of Laban saying Jacob has taken all that was our fathers and being enlarged by his ability he has become famousLikewise he observed that Labans face was not the same toward him as it was yesterday and the day beforeMost importantly the Lord was saying to him Return to the land of your fathers and to your generation and I will be with youHe sent and called for Rachel and Leah in the field where he pastured the flocksand he said to them I see that your fathers face is not the same toward me as it was yesterday and the day before But the God of my father has been with meAnd you know that I have served your father with all my strengthEven so your father has circumvented me and he has changed my wages ten times And yet God has not permitted him to harm meWhenever he said The speckled will be your wages all the sheep gave birth to speckled newborns Yet truly when he said the contrary You will take whatever is white for your wages all the flocks gave birth to white onesAnd it is God who has taken your fathers substance and given it to meFor after the time had arrived for the ewes to conceive I lifted up my eyes and I saw in my sleep that the males climbing on the females were of variegated and spotted and diverse colorsAnd the Angel of God said to me in my sleep Jacob And I responded Here I amAnd he said Lift up your eyes and see that all the males climbing on the females are variegated spotted and also speckled For I have seen all that Laban has done to youI am the God of Bethel where you anointed the stone and made a vow to me Now therefore arise and depart from this land returning to the land of your nativity And Rachel and Leah responded Have we anything left behind among the resources and inheritance of our fathers houseHas he not considered us as foreigners and sold us and consumed our priceBut God has taken our fathers riches and handed these to us and to our sons Therefore do all that God has instructed youAnd so Jacob rose up and having placed the children and his wives upon camels he went forthAnd he took all his substance and flocks and whatever he had acquired in Mesopotamia and he journeyed to his father Isaac in the land of CanaanAt that time Laban had gone to shear the sheep and so Rachel stole her fathers idolsAnd Jacob was not willing to confess to his father-in-law that he was fleeingAnd when he had gone away with all such things that were justly his and having crossed the river was continuing on toward Mount Gileadit was reported to Laban on the third day that Jacob had fledAnd taking his brothers with him he pursued him for seven days And he overtook him at Mount GileadAnd he saw in a dream God saying to him Beware that you not speak anything harsh against JacobAnd now Jacob had pitched his tent at the mountain And when he with his brothers had overtaken him he set his tent at the same place at Mount GileadAnd he said to Jacob Why have you acted this way departing from me in secret with my daughters like captives of the swordWhy would you want to flee without my knowledge and without telling me though I might have led you forward with gladness and songs and timbrels and lyresYou have not permitted me to kiss my sons and daughters You have acted foolishly And now indeedmy hand has power to repay you with harm But the God of your father said to me yesterday Beware that you not speak anything stern against JacobIt may be that you desired to go to your own and that you longed for the house of your father But why have you stolen my godsJacob answered I set out unknown to you because I feared that you might take away your daughters by violenceBut since you accuse me of theft with whomever you will find your gods let him be slain in the sight of our brothers Search anything of yours that you will find with me take it away Now when he said this he did not know that Rachel had stolen the idolsAnd so Laban entering the tent of Jacob and of Leah and of both the handmaids did not find them And when he had entered the tent of Rachelshe quickly hid the idols under the camels bedding and she sat upon them And when he had searched the entire tent and found nothingshe said Do not be angry my lord that I am unable to rise up in your sight because it has now happened to me according to the custom of women So his careful search was thwartedAnd Jacob being inflated said with contention For which fault of mine or for what sin of mine have you become so enraged against meand searched all the items of my house What have you found from all the substance of your house Place it here before my brothers and your brothers and let them judge between me and youFor what reason have I been with you for twenty years Your ewes and she-goats were not barren the rams of your flocks I did not consumeNeither did I reveal to you what was seized by the wild beast I replaced all that was damaged Whatever was lost by theft you collected it from meDay and night I was burned by heat and by frost and sleep fled from my eyesAnd in this way for twenty years I have served you in your house fourteen for your daughters and six for your flocks You have also changed my wages ten timesIf the God of my father Abraham and the fear of Isaac had not been close to me perhaps by now you would have sent me away naked But God looked kindly on my affliction and the labor of my hands and he rebuked you yesterdayLaban answered him My daughters and sons and your flocks and all that you discern are mine What can I do to my sons and grandchildrenCome therefore let us enter into a pact so that it may be a testimony between me and youAnd so Jacob took a stone and he set it up as a memorialAnd he said to his brothers Bring stones And they gathering together stones made a tomb and they ate upon itAnd Laban called it Tomb of Witness and Jacob Pile of Testimony each of them according to the fitness of his own languageAnd Laban said This tomb will be a witness between me and you this day And for this reason its name has been called Gilead that is Tomb of WitnessMay the Lord consider and judge between us when we will have withdrawn from one anotherIf you afflict my daughters and if you bring in other wives over them no one is a witness of our words except God who understands beforehandAnd again he said to Jacob Lo this tomb and the stone that I have set up between me and youwill be a witness This tomb I say and the stone they are for testimony in case either I cross beyond it going toward you or you cross beyond it thinking to harm meMay the God of Abraham and the God of Nahor the God of their father judge between us Therefore Jacob swore by the fear of his father IsaacAnd after he had immolated sacrifices on the mountain he called his brothers to eat bread And when they had eaten they lodged thereIn truth Laban rose up in the night and he kissed his sons and daughters and he blessed them And he returned to his placeLikewise Jacob continued on the journey that he had begun And the Angels of God met himWhen he had seen them he said These are the Encampments of God And he called the name of that place Mahanaim that is EncampmentsThen he also sent messengers before him to his brother Esau in the land of Seir in the region of EdomAnd he instructed them saying You shall speak in this way to my lord Esau Your brother Jacob says these things I have sojourned with Laban and I have been with him until the present dayI have oxen and donkeys and sheep and men servants and women servants And now I send an ambassador to my lord so that I may find favor in your sight  And the messengers returned to Jacob saying We went to your brother Esau and behold he rushes to meet you with four hundred menJacob was very afraid And in his terror he divided the people who were with him likewise the flocks and the sheep and the oxen and the camels into two companiessaying If Esau goes to one company and strikes it the other company which is left behind will be savedAnd Jacob said God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac O Lord who said to me Return to your land and to the place of your nativity and I will do well for youI am less than any of your compassions and your truth which you have fulfilled to your servant With my staff I crossed over this Jordan And now I go back with two companiesRescue me from the hand of my brother Esau for I am very afraid of him lest perhaps he may come and strike down the mother with the sonsYou did say that you would do well by me and that you would expand my offspring like the sand of the sea which because of its multitude cannot be numberedAnd when he had slept there that night he separated from the things that he had gifts for his brother Esautwo hundred she-goats twenty he-goats two hundred ewes and twenty ramsthirty milking camels with their young forty cows and twenty bulls twenty she-donkeys and ten of their youngAnd he sent them by the hands of his servants each flock separately and he said to his servants Pass before me and let there be a space between flock and flockAnd he instructed the first saying If you happen to meet my brother Esau and he questions you Whose are you or Where are you going or Whose are these which follow youyou shall respond Your servant Jacobs He has sent them as a gift to my lord Esau And he is also coming after usSimilarly he gave orders to the second and the third and to all who followed the flocks saying Speak these same words to Esau when you find himAnd you will add Your servant Jacob himself also follows after us for he said I will appease him with the gifts that go ahead and after this I will see him perhaps he will be gracious to me  And so the gifts went before him but he himself lodged that night in the campAnd when he had arisen early he took his two wives and the same number of handmaids with his eleven sons and he crossed over the ford of JabbokAnd having delivered over all the things that belonged to himhe remained alone And behold a man wrestled with him until morningAnd when he saw that he would not be able to overcome him he touched the nerve of his thigh and immediately it witheredAnd he said to him Release me for now the dawn ascends He responded I will not release you unless you bless meTherefore he said What is your name He answered JacobBut he said Your name will not be called Jacob but Israel for if you have been strong against God how much more will you prevail against menJacob questioned him Tell me by what name are you called He responded Why do you ask my name And he blessed him in the same placeAnd Jacob called the name of the place Peniel saying I have seen God face to face and my soul has been savedAnd immediately the sun rose upon him after he had crossed beyond Peniel Yet in truth he limped on his footFor this reason the sons of Israel even to the present day do not eat the nerve that withered in Jacobs thigh because he touched the nerve of his thigh and it was obstructedThen Jacob lifting up his eyes saw Esau arriving and with him four hundred men And he divided the sons of Leah and Rachel and of both the handmaidsAnd he placed the two handmaids and their children at the beginning Truly Leah and her sons were in the second place Then Rachel and Joseph were lastAnd advancing he reverenced prostrate on the ground seven times until his brother approachedAnd so Esau ran to meet his brother and he embraced him And drawing him by his neck and kissing him he weptAnd lifting up his eyes he saw the women and their little ones and he said What do these want for themselves and Are they related to you He responded These are the little ones that God has given as a gift to me your servantThen the handmaids and their sons approached and bowed downLikewise Leah with her sons came near And when they had reverenced similarly last of all Joseph and Rachel reverencedAnd Esau said What are these companies that I have been meeting He responded So may I find favor before my lordBut he said I have plenty my brother let these be for yourselfAnd Jacob said I beg you let it not be so But if I have found favor in your eyes receive a small present from my hands For I have looked upon your face as I would look upon the countenance of God Be gracious to meand take the blessing which I have brought to you and which God who bestows all things has given as a gift to me Accepting it reluctantly at the insistence of his brotherhe said Let us go on together and I will accompany you on your journeyAnd Jacob said My lord you know that I have with me tender little ones and sheep and cows with young If I cause these to labor too much in walking all the flocks will die in one dayMay it please my lord to go before his servant And I will follow gradually in his steps as much as I see my little ones to be able until I arrive to my lord in SeirEsau responded I beg you that at least some of the people who are with me may remain to accompany you on the way But he said There is no need I have need of one thing only to find favor in your sight my lordAnd so Esau returned that day by the way that he had arrived to SeirAnd Jacob went to Succoth where having built a house and pitched tents he called the name of that place Succoth that is TentsAnd he crossed over to Salem a city of the Shechemites which is in the land of Canaan after he returned from Mesopotamia of Syria And he lived near the townAnd he bought the part of the field in which he had pitched his tents from the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for one hundred lambsAnd erecting an altar there he invoked upon it the most strong God of IsraelThen Dinah the daughter of Leah went out to see the women of that regionAnd when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite the leader of that land had seen her he fell in love with her And so he seized her and slept with her overwhelming the virgin by forceAnd his soul was closely bound to her and since she was sorrowful he soothed her with flatteryAnd going on to Hamor his father he said Obtain this girl for me as a mateBut when Jacob had heard this since his sons were absent and he was occupied in pasturing the cattle he remained silent until they came backThen when Hamor the father of Shechem had gone out to speak to Jacobbehold his sons arrived from the field And hearing what had happened they were very angry because he had done a filthy thing in Israel and in violating a daughter of Jacob had perpetrated an unlawful actAnd so Hamor spoke to them The soul of my son Shechem has become attached to your daughter Give her to him as a wifeAnd let us celebrate marriages with one with another Give us your daughters and receive our daughtersAnd live with us The land is in your power cultivate trade and possess itAnd Shechem even said to her father and to her brothers May I find favor in your sight and whatever you will appoint I will giveIncrease the dowry and request gifts and I will freely bestow what you will ask Only give me this girl as a wifeThe sons of Jacob answered Shechem and his father with deceit being enraged at the rape of their sisterWe are not able to do what you ask nor to give our sister to an uncircumcised man For us this is unlawful and abominableBut we may succeed in this so as to be allied with you if you are willing to become like us and if all the male sex among you will be circumcisedThen we will mutually give and receive your daughters as well as ours and we will live with you and we will become one peopleBut if you will not be circumcised we will take our daughter and withdrawTheir offer pleased Hamor and his son ShechemNeither did the young man cause any delay in fact he immediately fulfilled what was requested For he loved the girl very much and he was well-known throughout his fathers houseAnd entering at the gate of the city they spoke to the peopleThese men are peaceful and they want to live among us Let them trade in the land and cultivate it for being spacious and broad it is in need of cultivation We will receive their daughters as wives and we will give them oursThere is one thing that prevents so great a good whether we will circumcise our males imitating the ritual of their nationAnd their substance and cattle and all that they possess will be ours if only we will acquiesce to this and so in living together will form one peopleAnd they all agreed to circumcise every one of the malesAnd behold on the third day when the pain of the wound was greatest two of the sons of Jacob Simeon and Levi the brothers of Dinah boldly entered the city with swords And they put to death all of the malesThey killed Hamor and Shechem together taking their sister Dinah from the house of ShechemAnd when they had departed the other sons of Jacob rushed over the slain and they plundered the city in vengeance for the rapeTaking their sheep and herds and donkeys and laying waste to everything else that was in their houses and in their fieldsthey also took their little ones and their wives captiveWhen they had boldly completed these acts Jacob said to Simeon and Levi You have troubled me and you have made me hateful to the Canaanites and the Perizzites the inhabitants of this land We are few They gathering themselves together may strike me down and then both I and my house will be wiped awayThey responded Should they abuse our sister like a prostituteAbout this time God said to Jacob Arise and go up to Bethel and live there and make an altar to God who appeared to you when you fled from your brother EsauIn truth Jacob having called together all his house said Cast away the foreign gods that are in your midst and be cleansed and also change your garmentsArise and let us go up to Bethel so that we may make an altar there to God who heeded me in the day of my tribulation and who accompanied me on my journeyTherefore they gave him all the foreign gods which they had and the earrings which were in their ears And then he buried them under the terebinth tree which is beyond the city of ShechemAnd when they had set out the terror of God invaded all the surrounding cities and they dared not pursue them as they withdrewAnd so Jacob arrived at Luz which is in the land of Canaan also named Bethel he and all the people with himAnd he built an altar there and he called the name of that place House of God For there God appeared to him when he fled from his brotherAbout the same time Deborah the nurse of Rebekah died and she was buried at the base of Bethel under an oak tree And the name of that place was called Oak of WeepingThen God appeared again to Jacob after he returned from Mesopotamia of Syria and he blessed himsaying You will no longer be called Jacob for your name shall be Israel And he called him Israeland he said to him I am Almighty God increase and multiply Tribes and peoples of nations will be from you and kings will go forth from your loinsAnd the land that I gave to Abraham and Isaac I will give to you and to your offspring after youAnd he withdrew from himIn truth he set up a monument of stone in the place where God had spoken to him pouring out libations over it and pouring oiland he called the name of that place BethelThen departing from there he arrived in springtime at the land that leads to Ephrath And there when Rachel was giving birthbecause it was a difficult birth she began to be in danger And the midwife said to her Do not be afraid for you will have this son alsoThen when her life was departing because of the pain and death was now imminent she called the name of her son Benoni that is the son of my pain Yet truly his father called him Benjamin that is the son of the right handAnd so Rachel died and she was buried in the way that leads to Ephrath this place is BethlehemAnd Jacob erected a monument over her sepulcher This is the monument to Rachels tomb even to the present dayDeparting from there he pitched his tent beyond the Tower of the FlockAnd when he was living in that region Reuben went out and he slept with Bilhah the concubine of his father which was not such a small matter as to be hidden from him Now the sons of Jacob were twelveThe sons of Leah Reuben the first born and Simeon and Levi and Judah and Issachar and ZebulunThe sons of Rachel Joseph and BenjaminThe sons of Bilhah handmaid of Rachel Dan and NaphtaliThe sons of Zilpah handmaid of Leah Gad and Asher These are the sons of Jacob who were born to him in Mesopotamia of SyriaAnd then he went to his father Isaac in Mamre the city of Arba this place is Hebron where Abraham and Isaac sojournedAnd the days of Isaac were completed one hundred and eighty yearsAnd being consumed by old age he died And he was placed with his people being old and full of days And his sons Esau and Jacob buried himNow these are the generations of Esau who is EdomEsau took wives from the daughters of Canaan Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hiviteand Basemath the daughter of Ishmael sister of NebaiothThen Adah bore Eliphaz Basemath conceived ReuelOholibamah conceived Jeush and Jalam and Korah These are the sons of Esau who were born to him in the land of CanaanThen Esau took his wives and sons and daughters and every soul of his house and his substance and cattle and whatever he was able to obtain in the land of Canaan and he went into another region withdrawing from his brother JacobFor they were very wealthy and were not able to live together Neither was the land of their sojourn able to sustain them because of the multitude of their flocksAnd Esau lived at mount Seir he is EdomSo these are the generations of Esau the father of Edom at mount Seirand these are the names of his sons Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau likewise Reuel the son of Basemath his wifeAnd Eliphaz had sons Teman Omar Zepho and Gatam and KenezNow Timna was the concubine of Eliphaz the son of Esau And she bore him Amalek These are the sons of Adah the wife of EsauAnd the sons of Reuel were Nahath and Zerah Shammah and Mizzah These are the sons of Basemath the wife of EsauLikewise these were the sons of Oholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon the wife of Esau whom she bore to him Jeush and Jalam and KorahThese were leaders of the sons of Esau the sons of Eliphaz the firstborn of Esau leader Teman leader Omar leader Zepho leader Kenezleader Korah leader Gatam leader Amalek These are the sons of Eliphaz in the land of Edom and these the sons of AdahLikewise these are the sons of Reuel the son of Esau leader Nahath leader Zerah leader Shammah leader Mizzah And these were the leaders of Reuel in the land of Edom These are the sons of Basemath the wife of EsauNow these are the sons of Oholibamah the wife of Esau leader Jeush leader Jalam leader Korah These were the leaders of Oholibamah the daughter of Anah and the wife of EsauThese are the sons of Esau and these were their leaders this is EdomThese are the sons of Seir the Horite the inhabitants of the land Lotan and Shobal and Zibeon and Anahand Dishon and Ezer and Dishan These were the leaders of the Horites the sons of Seir in the land of EdomNow Lotan produced sons Hori and Heman But the sister of Lotan was TimnaAnd these are the sons of Shobal Alvan and Manahath and Ebal and Shepho and OnamAnd these are the sons of Zibeon Aiah and Anah This is the Anah who found the hot springs in the wilderness when he was pasturing the donkeys of his father ZibeonAnd he had a son Dishon and a daughter OholibamahAnd these are the sons of Dishon Hemdan and Esheban and Ithran and CheranLikewise these are the sons of Ezer Bilhan and Zaavan and AkanThen Dishan had sons Uz and AranThese were the leaders of the Horites leader Lotan leader Shobal leader Zibeon leader Anahleader Dishon leader Ezer leader Disan These were leaders of the Horites who ruled in the land of SeirNow before the sons of Israel had a king the kings who ruled in the land of Edom were theseBela the son of Beor and the name of his city was DinhabahThen Bela died and Jobab the son of Zerah from Bozrah reigned in his placeAnd when Jobab was dead Husham of the land of the Temanites reigned in his placeLikewise this one having died Hadad the son of Bedad reigned in his place He struck down Midian in the region of Moab And the name of his city was AvithAnd when Adad was dead Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his placeLikewise this one being dead Shaul of the river Rehoboth reigned in his placeAnd when he also had passed away Baal-hanan the son of Achbor succeeded to the kingdomLikewise this one being dead Hadar reigned in his place and the name of his city was Pau And his wife was called Mehetabel the daughter of Matred daughter of MezahabTherefore these were the names of the leaders of Esau by their families and places and in their vocabulary leader Timna leader Alvah leader Jethethleader Oholibamah leader Elah leader Pinonleader Kanez leader Teman leader Mibzarleader Magdiel leader Iram These were the leaders of Edom living in the land of their rule this is Esau the father of IdumeaNow Jacob lived in the land of Canaan where his father sojournedAnd these are his generations Joseph when he was sixteen years old was pasturing the flock with his brothers when he was still a boy And he was with the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah the wives of his father And he accused his brothers to their father of a most sinful crimeNow Israel loved Joseph above all his sons because he had conceived him in his old age And he made him a tunic woven of many colorsThen his brothers seeing that he was loved by his father more than all his other sons hated him and they were not able to say anything peacefully to himThen it also happened that he recounted the vision of a dream to his brothers for which reason a greater hatred began to be nurturedAnd he said to them Listen to my dream that I sawI thought we were binding sheaves in the field And my sheaf seemed to rise up and stand and your sheaves standing in a circle reverenced my sheafHis brothers responded Would you be our king Or will we be subject to your dominion Therefore this matter of his dreams and words provided kindling to their envy and hatredLikewise he saw another dream which he explained to his brothers saying I saw by a dream as if the sun and the moon and eleven stars were reverencing meAnd when he had related this to his father and brothers his father rebuked him and he said What does it mean to you this dream that you have seen Should I and your mother and your brothers reverence you upon the earthTherefore his brothers were envious of him Yet truly his father considered the matter silentlyAnd while his brothers were lodging at Shechem pasturing their fathers flocksIsrael said to him Your brothers are pasturing the sheep at Shechem Come I will send you to them And when he answeredI am ready he said to him Go and see if everything is prospering with your brothers and the cattle and report to me what is happening So having been sent from the valley of Hebron he arrived at ShechemAnd a man found him wandering in a field and he asked him what he was seekingSo he responded I seek my brothers Tell me where they pasture the flocksAnd the man said to him They have withdrawn from this place But I heard them saying Let us go to Dothan  Therefore Joseph continued on after his brothers and he found them at DothanAnd when they had seen him from afar before he approached them they decided to kill himAnd they said one to another Behold the dreamer approachesCome let us kill him and cast him into the old cistern And let us say an evil wild beast has devoured him And then it will become apparent what his dreams will do for himBut Reuben on hearing this strove to free him from their hands and he saidDo not take away his life nor shed blood But throw him into this cistern which is in the wilderness and so keep your hands harmless But he said this wanting to rescue him from their hands so as to return him to his fatherAnd so as soon as he came to his brothers they very quickly stripped him of his tunic which was ankle-length and woven of many colorsand they cast him into an old cistern which held no waterAnd sitting down to eat bread they saw some Ishmaelites travelers coming from Gilead with their camels carrying spices and resin and oil of myrrh into EgyptTherefore Judah said to his brothers What will it profit us if we kill our brother and conceal his bloodIt is better that he be sold to the Ishmaelites and then our hands will not be defiled For he is our brother and our flesh His brothers agreed to his wordsAnd when the Midianite merchants were passing by they drew him from the cistern and they sold him to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver And these led him into EgyptAnd Reuben returning to the cistern did not find the boyAnd rending his garments he went to his brothers and said The boy is not present and so where shall I goThen they took his tunic and they dipped it in the blood of a young goat which they had killedsending those who carried it to their father and they said We found this See whether it is the tunic of your son or notAnd when the father acknowledged it he said It is the tunic of my son An evil wild beast has eaten him a beast has devoured JosephAnd tearing his garments he was clothed in haircloth mourning his son for a long timeThen when all of his sons gathered together to ease their fathers sorrow he was not willing to accept consolation but he said I will descend in mourning to my son in the underworld And while he persevered in weepingthe Midianites in Egypt sold Joseph to Potiphar a eunuch of Pharaoh instructor of the soldiersAbout the same time Judah descending from his brothers turned toward an Adullamite man named HirahAnd he saw there the daughter of a man called Shua of Canaan And taking her as a wife he entered to herAnd she conceived and bore a son and she called his name ErAnd conceiving offspring again having given birth to a son she called him OnanLikewise she bore a third whom she called Shelah after whose birth she ceased to bear any moreThen Judah gave a wife to his first born Er whose name was TamarAnd it also happened that Er the first born of Judah was wicked in the sight of the Lord and was killed by himTherefore Judah said to his son Onan Enter to the wife of your brother and associate with her so that you may raise offspring to your brotherHe knowing that the sons to be born would not be his when he entered to the wife of his brother he spilled his seed on the ground lest children should be born in his brothers nameAnd for this reason the Lord struck him down because he did a detestable thingBecause of this matter Judah said to his daughter-in-law Tamar Be a widow in your fathers house until my son Shelah grows up For he was afraid lest he also might die just as his brothers did She went away and she lived in her fathers houseThen after many days had passed the daughter of Shua the wife of Judah died And when he accepted consolation after his mourning he went up to the shearers of his sheep at Timnah he and Hirah the herdsman of the Adullamite flockAnd it was reported to Tamar that her father-in-law had gone up to Timnah to shear the sheepAnd storing away the garments of her widowhood she took up a veil And changing her clothing she sat at the crossroad that leads to Timnah because Shelah had grown up and she had not received him as a husbandAnd when Judah saw her he thought her to be a harlot For she had covered her face lest she be recognizedAnd entering to her he said Permit me to join with you For he did not know her to be his daughter-in-law And she responded What will you give to me to enjoy me as a concubineHe said I will send you a young goat from the flock And again she said I will allow what you want if you give me a pledge until you may send what you promiseJudah said What do you want to be given for a pledge She responded Your ring and bracelet and the staff that you hold in your hand Thereupon the woman from one sexual encounter conceivedAnd she arose and went away And storing away the garments that she had taken up she was clothed in the garments of her widowhoodThen Judah sent a young goat by his shepherd the Adullamite so that he might receive the pledge that he had given to the woman But when he had not found herhe questioned the men of that place Where is the woman who sat at the crossroad And they all responded There has been no harlot in this placeHe returned to Judah and he said to him I did not find her Moreover the men of that place told me that a prostitute had never sat thereJudah said Let her hold herself to blame Certainly she is not able to accuse us of a lie I sent the young goat that I had promised and you did not find herAnd behold after three months they reported to Judah saying Tamar your daughter-in-law has committed fornication and her abdomen appears to be enlarged And Judah said Produce her so that she may be burnedBut when she was led out to the punishment she sent to her father-in-law saying I conceived by the man to whom these things belong Recognize whose ring and bracelet and staff this isBut he acknowledging the gifts said She is more just than I am For I did not deliver her to my son Shelah However he knew her no moreThen at the moment of birth there appeared twins in the womb And so in the very delivery of the infants one put forth a hand on which the midwife tied a scarlet thread sayingThis one will go out firstBut in truth drawing back his hand the other came out And the woman said Why is the partition divided for you And for this reason she called his name PerezAfter this his brother came out on whose hand was the scarlet thread And she called him ZerahMeanwhile Joseph was led into Egypt And Putiphar a eunuch of Pharaoh a leader of the army an Egyptian man purchased him from the hand of the Ishmaelites by whom he was broughtAnd the Lord was with him and he was a man who prospered in everything that he did And he lived in the house of his lordwho knew very well that the Lord was with him and that all the things that were done by him were directed by his handAnd Joseph found favor in the sight of his lord and he ministered to him And having been placed in charge of everything by him he governed the house that was entrusted to him and all the things that had been delivered to himAnd the Lord blessed the house of the Egyptian because of Joseph and he multiplied all his substance as much in the buildings as in the fieldsNeither did he know anything other than the bread that he ate Now Joseph was beautiful in form and stately in appearanceAnd so after many days his mistress cast her eyes on Joseph and she said Sleep with meAnd without consenting at all to the wicked act he said to her Behold my lord has delivered all things to me and he does not know what he has in his own houseNeither is there anything which is not in my power or that he has not delivered to me except you for you are his wife How then can I do this evil act and sin against my GodWith such words as these throughout each day the woman was pestering the young man and he was refusing the adulteryThen it happened on a certain day that Joseph entered the house and he was doing something without any witnessesAnd she grasping the hem of his garment said Sleep with me But he leaving behind the cloak in her hand fled and went outsideAnd when the woman saw the garment in her hands and herself being treated with disrespectshe called to herself the men of her house and she said to them Lo he has brought in a Hebrew man to abuse us He entered toward me in order to join with me and when I had shouted outand he had heard my voice he left behind the cloak that I held and he fled outsideAs a proof therefore of her fidelity she retained the cloak and she showed it to her husband when he returned homeAnd she said The Hebrew servant whom you have brought in to me approached me to abuse meAnd when he had heard me cry out he left behind the cloak that I held and he fled outsideHis lord upon hearing these things and having excessive trust in the words of his mate was very angryAnd he delivered Joseph into prison where the prisoners of the king were kept and he was enclosed in that placeBut the Lord was with Joseph and having mercy on him he gave him favor in the sight of the leader of the prisonwho delivered into his hand all the prisoners who were held in custody And whatever was done was under himNeither did he himself know anything having entrusted all things to him For the Lord was with him and he directed everything that he didWhile these things were going on it happened that two eunuchs the cupbearer of the king of Egypt and the miller of grain offended their lordAnd Pharaoh being angry with them now the one was in charge of the cupbearers the other of the millers of grainsent them to the prison of the leader of the military in which Joseph also was a prisonerBut the keeper of the prison delivered them to Joseph who ministered to them also Some little time passed by while they were held in custodyAnd they both saw a similar dream on one night whose interpretations should be related to one anotherAnd when Joseph had entered to them in the morning and had seen them sadhe consulted them saying Why is your expression sadder today than usualThey responded We have seen a dream and there is no one to interpret it for us And Joseph said to them Doesnt interpretation belong to God Recount for me what you have seenThe chief cupbearer explained his dream first I saw before me a vineon which were three shoots which grew little by little into buds and after the flowers it matured into grapesAnd the cup of Pharaoh was in my hand Therefore I took the grapes and I pressed them into the cup that I held and I handed the cup to PharaohJoseph responded This is the interpretation of the dream The three shoots are the next three daysafter which Pharaoh will remember your service and he will restore you to your former position And you will give him the cup according to your office as you were accustomed to do beforeOnly remember me when it will be well with you and do me this mercy to suggest to Pharaoh to lead me out of this prisonFor I have been stolen from the land of the Hebrews and here innocently I was cast into the pitThe chief miller of grain seeing that he had wisely unraveled the dream said I also saw a dream that I had three baskets of meal above my headand in one basket which was the highest I carried all foods that are made by the art of baking and the birds ate from itJoseph responded This is the interpretation of the dream The three baskets are the next three daysafter which Pharaoh will carry away your head and also suspend you from a cross and the birds will tear your fleshThe third day thereafter was the birthday of Pharaoh And making a great feast for his servants he remembered during the banquet the chief cupbearer and the chief miller of grainAnd he restored the one to his place to present him the cupthe other he hanged on a gallows and thus the truth of the interpreter of dreams was provenAnd although he advanced with so much prosperity the chief cupbearer forgot his interpreter of dreamsAfter two years Pharaoh saw a dream He thought himself to be standing above a riverfrom which ascended seven cows exceedingly beautiful and stout And they pastured in marshy placesLikewise another seven emerged from the river filthy and thoroughly emaciated And they pastured on the same bank of the river in green placesAnd they devoured those whose appearance and condition of body was so wonderful Pharaoh having been awakenedslept again and he saw another dream Seven ears of grain sprung up on one stalk full and well-formedLikewise other ears of grain of the same number rose up thin and struck with blightdevouring all the beauty of the first Pharaoh when he awakened after his restand when morning arrived being terrified with fear sent to all the interpreters of Egypt and to all of the wise men And when they were summoned he explained to them his dream but there was no one who could interpret itThen at last the chief cupbearer remembering said I confess my sinThe king being angry with his servants ordered me and the chief miller of grain to be forced into the prison of the leader of the militaryThere in one night both of us saw a dream presaging the futureIn that place there was a Hebrew a servant of the same commander of the military to whom we explained our dreamsWhatever we heard was proven afterwards by the event of the matter For I was restored to my office and he was suspended on a crossImmediately by the kings authority Joseph was led out of prison and they shaved him And changing his apparel they presented him to himAnd he said to him I have seen dreams and there is no one who can unfold them I have heard that you are very wise at interpreting theseJoseph responded Apart from me God will respond favorably to PharaohTherefore Pharaoh explained what he had seen I thought myself to be standing on the bank of a riverand seven cows climbed up from the river exceedingly beautiful and full of flesh And they grazed in a pasture of a marshy greeneryAnd behold there followed after these another seven cows with such deformity and emaciation as I had never seen in the land of EgyptThese devoured and consumed the firstgiving no indication of being full But they remained in the same state of emaciation and squalor Awakening but being weighed down into sleep againI saw a dream Seven ears of grain sprang up on one stalk full and very beautifulLikewise another seven thin and struck with blight rose up from the stalkAnd they devoured the beauty of the first I explained this dream to the interpreters and there is no one who can unfold itJoseph responded The dream of the king is one What God will do he has revealed to PharaohThe seven beautiful cows and the seven full ears of grain are seven years of abundance And so the force of the dreams is understood to be the sameLikewise the seven thin and emaciated cows which ascended after them and the seven thin ears of grain which were struck with the burning wind are seven approaching years of famineThese will be fulfilled in this orderBehold there will arrive seven years of great fertility throughout the entire land of EgyptAfter this there will follow another seven years of such great barrenness that all the former abundance will be delivered into oblivion For the famine will consume all the landand the greatness of this destitution will cause the greatness of the abundance to be lostNow as to what you saw the second time it is a dream pertaining to the same thing It is an indication of its firmness because the word of God shall be done and it shall be completed swiftlyNow therefore let the king provide a wise and industrious man and place him over the land of Egyptso that he may appoint overseers throughout all the regions And let a fifth part of the fruits throughout the seven fertile yearsthat now have already begun to occur be gathered into storehouses And let all the grain be stored away under the power of Pharaoh and let it be kept in the citiesAnd let it be prepared for the future famine of seven years which will oppress Egypt and then the land will not be consumed by destitutionThe counsel pleased Pharaoh and all his ministersAnd he said to them Would we be able to find another such man who is full of the Spirit of GodTherefore he said to Joseph Because God has revealed to you all that you have said would I be able to find anyone wiser and as much like youYou will be over my house and to the authority of your mouth all the people will show obedience Only in one way in the throne of the kingdom will I go before youAnd again Pharaoh said to Joseph Behold I have appointed you over the entire land of EgyptAnd he took the ring from his own hand and he gave it into his hand And he clothed him with a robe of fine linen and he placed a necklace of gold around his neckAnd he caused him to ascend upon his second swift chariot with the herald proclaiming that everyone should bend their knee before him and that they should know that he was governor over the entire land of EgyptLikewise the king said to Joseph I am Pharaoh apart from your authority no one will move hand or foot in all the land of EgyptAnd he changed his name and called him in the Egyptian tongue Savior of the world And he gave him as a wife Asenath the daughter of Potiphera priest of Heliopolis And so Joseph went out into the land of EgyptNow he was thirty years old when he stood in the sight of king Pharaoh And he traveled throughout the regions of EgyptAnd the fertility of the seven years arrived And when the grain fields were reduced to sheaves these were gathered into the storehouses of EgyptAnd now all the abundance of grain was stored away in every cityAnd there was such a great abundance of wheat that it was comparable to the sands of the sea and its bounty exceeded all measureThen before the famine arrived Joseph had two sons born whom Asenath the daughter of Potiphera priest of Heliopolis bore for himAnd he called the name of the firstborn Manasseh saying God has caused me to forget all my labors and the house of my fatherLikewise he named the second Ephraim saying God has caused me to increase in the land of my povertyAnd so when the seven years of fertility that occurred in Egypt had passedthe seven years of destitution which Joseph had predicted began to arrive And the famine prevailed throughout the whole world but there was bread in all the land of EgyptAnd being hungry the people cried out to Pharaoh asking for provisions And he said to them Go to Joseph And do whatever he will tell youThen the famine increased daily in all the land And Joseph opened all of the storehouses and sold to the Egyptians For the famine had oppressed them alsoAnd all the provinces came to Egypt to buy food and to temper the misfortune of their destitutionThen Jacob hearing that food was being sold in Egypt said to his sons Why are you negligentI have heard that wheat is being sold in Egypt Go down and buy necessities for us so that we may be able to live and not be consumed by destitutionAnd so when ten brothers of Joseph went down to buy grain in EgyptBenjamin was kept at home by Jacob who said to his brothers Lest perhaps he may suffer harm on the journeyAnd they entered into the land of Egypt with the others who traveled to buy For the famine was in the land of CanaanAnd Joseph was governor in the land of Egypt and grain was sold under his direction to the people And when his brothers had reverenced himand he had recognized them he spoke harshly as if to foreigners questioning them Where did you come from And they responded From the land of Canaan to buy necessary provisionsAnd although he knew his brothers he was not known by themAnd remembering the dreams which he had seen in another time he said to them You are scouts You have come in order to see which parts of the land are weakerAnd they said It is not so my lord But your servants have arrived in order to buy foodWe are all sons of one man We have come in peace nor do any of your subjects devise evilAnd he answered them It is otherwise You have come to examine the unguarded parts of this landBut they said We your servants are twelve brothers the sons of one man in the land of Canaan The youngest is with our father the other is not livingHe said This is just as I have said You are scoutsI will now continue to put you to the test By the health of Pharaoh you will not depart from here until your youngest brother arrivesSend one of you and bring him But you will be in chains until what you have said is proven to be either true or false Otherwise by the health of Pharaoh you are scoutsTherefore he delivered them into custody for three daysThen on the third day he brought them out of prison and he said Do as I have said and you will live For I fear GodIf you are peaceful let one of your brothers be bound in prison Then you may go away and carry the grain that you have bought to your housesAnd bring your youngest brother to me so that I may be able to test your words and you may not die They did as he had saidand they spoke to one another We deserve to suffer these things because we have sinned against our brother seeing the anguish of his soul when he begged us and we would not listen For that reason this tribulation has come upon usAnd Reuben one of them said Did not I say to you Do not sin against the boy and you would not listen to me See his blood is exactedBut they did not know that Joseph understood because he was speaking to them through an interpreterAnd he turned himself away briefly and wept And returning he spoke to themAnd taking Simeon and binding him in their presence he ordered his ministers to fill their sacks with wheat and to replace each ones money in their sacks and to give them in addition provisions for the way And they did soThen having loaded their donkeys with the grain they set outAnd one of them opening a sack to give his beast of burden fodder at the inn looked upon the money at the sacks mouthand he said to his brothers My money has returned to me See it is held in the sack And they were astonished and troubled and they said to one another What is this that God has done to usAnd they went to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan and they explained to him all the things that had befallen them sayingThe lord of the land spoke harshly to us and he considered us to be scouts of the provinceAnd we answered him We are peaceful and we do not intend any treacheryWe are twelve brothers conceived of one father One is not living the youngest is with our father in the land of CanaanAnd he said to us Thus will I prove that you are peaceful Release one of your brothers to me and take necessary provisions for your houses and go awayand bring your youngest brother to me so that I may know that you are not scouts And this one who is held in chains you may be able to receive again And thereafter you shall have permission to buy what you want Having said this when they poured out their grain each found his money tied to the mouth of his sack And all were terrified togetherTheir father Jacob said You have caused me to be without children Joseph is not living Simeon is held in chains and Benjamin you would carry away All these evils have fallen back upon meAnd Reuben answered him Put my two sons to death if I do not lead him back to you Deliver him into my hand and I will restore him to youBut he said My son will not go down with you His brother is dead and he is left alone If any adversity will befall him in the land to which you travel you would lead my grey hairs down with sorrow to the graveMeanwhile the famine pressed heavily on all the landAnd having consumed the provisions that they had brought out of Egypt Jacob said to his sons Return and buy us a little foodJudah answered The man himself declared to us under the attestation of an oath saying You will not see my face unless you bring your youngest brother with youIf therefore you are willing to send him with us we will travel together and we will buy necessities for youBut if you are not willing we will not go For the man as we have often said declared to us saying You will not see my face without your youngest brother Israel said to them You have done this for my misery in that you revealed to him that you also had another brotherBut they responded The man questioned us in order concerning our family whether our father lived if we had a brother And we answered him respectively according to what he demanded How could we know that he would say Bring your brother with you Likewise Judah said to his father Send the boy with me so that we may set out and be able to live lest we and our little ones should dieI accept the boy require him at my hand Unless I lead him back and restore him to you I will be guilty of a sin against you for all timeIf a delay had not intervened by now we would have returned here a second timeTherefore their father Israel said to them If it is necessary to do so then do what you will Take in your vessels from the best fruits of the land and carry down gifts to the man a little resin and honey and storax ointment oil of myrrh turpentine and almondsAlso take with you double the money and carry back what you found in your sacks lest perhaps it was done in errorBut also take your brother and go to the manThen may my Almighty God cause him to be pleased by you And send your brother whom he holds back with you along with this one Benjamin But as for me without my children I will be like one who is bereavedTherefore the men took the gifts and double the money and Benjamin And they went down into Egypt and they stood in the presence of JosephAnd when he had seen them and Benjamin together he instructed the steward of his house saying Lead the men into the house and kill victims and prepare a feast because they will be eating with me at middayHe did what he had been ordered to do and he brought the men into the houseAnd there being terrified they said one to another Because of the money which we carried back the first time in our sacks we have been brought in so that he may unleash a false accusation against us and by violence subjugate both us and our donkeys into servitudeFor this reason approaching the steward of the house at his doorthey said We beg you lord to hear us We came down once before to buy foodAnd having bought it when we arrived at the inn we opened our sacks and found the money in the mouths of the sacks which we now have carried back in the same amountBut we have also brought other silver so that we may buy those things that are necessary for us It is not on our conscience who had placed it in our bagsBut he responded Peace be with you Do not be afraid Your God and the God of your father has given you the treasure in your sacks As for the money that you gave to me I held it as a test And he led Simeon out to themAnd having led them into the house he brought water and they washed their feet and he gave fodder to their donkeysBut they also prepared the gifts until Joseph entered at midday For they had heard that they would eat bread thereAnd so Joseph entered his house and they offered him the gifts holding them in their hands And they reverenced prone on the groundBut he gently greeting them again questioned them saying Is your father the old man about whom you spoke to me in good health Is he still aliveAnd they answered Your servant our father is safe he is still alive And bowing they reverenced himThen Joseph lifting up his eyes saw Benjamin his brother of the same womb and he said Is this your little brother about whom you spoke to me And again he said May God be compassionate to you my sonAnd he hurried out because his heart had been moved over his brother and tears gushed out And going into his chamber he weptAnd when he had washed his face coming out again he composed himself and he said Set out breadAnd when it was set out separately for Joseph and separately for his brothers likewise separately for the Egyptians who ate at the same time for it is unlawful for Egyptians to eat with Hebrews and they consider feasting in this way to be profanethey sat before him the firstborn according to his birthright and the youngest according to his state of life And they wondered exceedinglytaking the portions that they received from him And the greater portion went to Benjamin so much so that it exceeded five parts And they drank and became inebriated along with himThen Joseph instructed the steward of his house saying Fill their sacks with grain as much as they are able to hold And place each ones money at the top of the sackBut place my silver bowl and the price that he gave for the wheat in the mouth of the sack of the youngest And so it was doneAnd when morning arose they were sent away with their donkeysAnd now they had departed from the city and had set out a short distance Then Joseph sending for the steward of his house said Rise up and pursue the men And when you have overtaken them say Why have you returned evil for goodThe cup that you have stolen it is that from which my lord drinks and in which he is accustomed to discern signs You have done a very sinful thing He did as he had been ordered And having overtaken them he spoke to them according to the orderAnd they responded Why does our lord speak in this way as though your servants had committed such a shameful actThe money which we found at the top of our sacks we carried back to you from the land of Canaan So in what way does it follow that we would steal from the house of your lord gold or silverWhichever of your servants will be found to have what you seek may he die and we shall be the servants of my lordAnd he said to them Let it be according to your verdict With whomever it will be found let him be my servant but you will be unharmedAnd so they quickly placed their sacks down to the ground and each one was openedAnd when he had searched beginning with the oldest all the way to the youngest he found the cup in Benjamins sackBut they tearing their garments and burdening their donkeys again returned to the townAnd Judah first among his brothers entered to Joseph for he had not yet departed from the place and together they all fell down before him to the groundAnd he said to them Why would you choose to act in this way Could you be ignorant that there is no one like me in the knowledge of discerning signsAnd Judah said to him What could we answer to my lord And what would we be able to say or to justly claim God has discovered the iniquity of your servants See we have all become servants to my lord both we and he with whom the cup was foundJoseph responded Far be it from me that I should act in this way He who stole the cup he will be my servant But you may go away free to your fatherThen Judah approaching closer said confidently I beg you my lord let your servant speak a word in your ears and do not be angry with your servant For you are next to PharaohMy lord you questioned your servants before Do you have a father or a brotherAnd we answered you my lord There is our father an old man and a young boy who was born in his old age His brother of the same womb has died and he alone is left to his mother and father who truly love him tenderlyAnd you said to your servants Bring him to me and I will set my eyes on himWe suggested to my lord The boy is not able to leave his father For if he sends him away he will dieAnd you said to your servants Unless your youngest brother arrives with you you will not see my face any moreTherefore when we had gone up to your servant our father we explained to him all that my lord had spokenAnd our father said Return and buy us a little wheatAnd we said to him We cannot go If our youngest brother descends with us we will set out together Otherwise in his absence we do not dare to see the face of the manTo which he responded You know that my wife conceived twice by meOne went out and you said A beast devoured him And since then he has not appearedIf you take this one also and anything happens to him on the way you will lead my grey hairs down with grief to the graveTherefore if I would have gone to your servant our father with the boy not present though his life depends upon the life of himand if he were to see that he is not with us he would die and your servants will lead his grey hairs down with sorrow to the graveLet me be your very own servant for I accepted this one into my trust and I promised saying Unless I lead him back I will be guilty of a sin against my father for all timeAnd so I your servant will remain in place of the boy in ministry to my lord and then let the boy go up with his brothersFor I cannot return to my father without the boy lest I appear as a witness to the calamity that will oppress my fatherJoseph was unable to restrain himself any longer standing before so many Therefore he instructed that all should go outside and that no stranger should be among them as they recognized one anotherAnd he lifted up his voice with weeping which the Egyptians heard along with the entire house of PharaohAnd he said to his brothers I am Joseph Is my father still alive His brothers were unable to respond being terrified by a very great fearAnd he said to them mildly Approach toward me And when they had approached close by he said I am Joseph your brother whom you sold into EgyptDo not be afraid and let it not seem to you to be a hardship that you sold me into these regions For God sent me before you into Egypt for your salvationFor it is two years since the famine began to be upon the land and five years more remain in which there can be neither plowing nor reapingAnd God sent me ahead so that you may be preserved upon the earth and so that you would be able to have food in order to liveI was sent here not by your counsel but by the will of God He has caused me to be like a father to Pharaoh and to be the lord of his entire house as well as governor throughout all the land of EgyptHurry and go up to my father and say to him Your son Joseph commands this God has caused me to be lord of the entire land of Egypt Come down to me do not delayand you will live in the land of Goshen And you will be next to me you and your sons and the sons of your sons your sheep and your herds and all that you possessAnd there I will pasture you for there are still five years of famine remaining lest both you and your house perish along with all that you possessBehold your eyes and the eyes of my brother Benjamin can see that it is my mouth speaking to youYou will report to my father about all my glory and about all that you have seen in Egypt Hurry and bring him to meAnd then falling upon the neck of his brother Benjamin he embraced him and wept And likewise Benjamin wept at the same time on his neckAnd Joseph kissed all his brothers and he cried over each one After this they were emboldened to speak to himAnd it was overheard and the news spread by word throughout the kings court The brothers of Joseph had arrived and Pharaoh was gladdened along with all his familyAnd he told Joseph that he should command his brothers saying  Burden your beasts and go into the land of Canaanand take from there your father and kindred and come to me And I will give you all the good things of Egypt so that you may eat from the marrow of the land And you may even instruct that they take wagons from the land of Egypt in order to transport their little ones as well as their wives And say Take your father and come quickly as soon as possibleYou need not give up anything from your household for all the riches of Egypt will be yours And the sons of Israel did just as they were commanded And Joseph gave them wagons according to the command of Pharaoh and provisions for the journeyLikewise he ordered two robes for each of them to be brought Yet truly to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver along with five of the best robesAnd he sent just as much money and clothing to his father adding also ten male donkeys with which to transport all the riches of Egypt and as many female donkeys carrying wheat and bread for the journeyThus he sent away his brothers and as they set out he said Do not become angry on the wayAnd they ascended out of Egypt and they arrived in the land of Canaan to their father JacobAnd they reported to him saying Your son Joseph is alive and he is ruler throughout all the land of Egypt When Jacob heard this he was stirred up as if from a deep sleep yet he did not believe themTo the contrary they explained the entire matter in order And when he had seen the wagons and all that he had sent his spirit revivedand he said It is enough for me if my son Joseph is still alive I will go and see him before I dieAnd Israel setting out with all that he had arrived at the Well of the Oath And sacrificing victims there to the God of his father Isaache heard him by a vision in the night calling him and saying to him Jacob Jacob And he answered him Behold here I amGod said to him I am the most strong God of your father Do not be afraid Descend into Egypt for there I will make of you a great nationI will descend with you to that place and I will lead you back from there returning Also Joseph will place his hands over your eyesThen Jacob rose up from the Well of the Oath And his sons took him with their little ones and wives in the wagons that Pharaoh had sent to carry the old manalong with all that he possessed in the land of Canaan And he arrived in Egypt with all his offspringhis sons and his grandsons his daughters and all his progeny togetherNow these are the names of the sons of Israel who entered into Egypt he with his children The firstborn is ReubenThe sons of Reuben Hanoch and Pallu and Hezron and CarmiThe sons of Simeon Jemuel and Jamin and Ohad and Jachin and Zohar and Shaul the son of a Canaanite womanThe sons of Levi Gershon and Kohath and MerariThe sons of Judah Er and Onan and Shelah and Perez and Zerah Now Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan And sons were born to Perez Hezron and HamulThe sons of Issachar Tola and Puvah and Job and ShimronThe sons of Zebulun Sered and Elon and JahleelThese are the sons of Leah whom she bore along with his daughter Dinah in Mesopotamia of Syria All the souls of her sons and daughters are thirty-threeThe sons of Gad Ziphion and Haggi and Shuni and Ezbon and Eri and Arodi and AreliThe sons of Asher Imnah and Jesua and Jessui and Beriah and also their sister Sarah The sons of Beria Heber and MalchielThese are the sons of Zilpah whom Laban gave to his daughter Leah And these she bore to Jacob sixteen soulsThe sons of Rachel the wife of Jacob Joseph and BenjaminAnd sons were born to Joseph in the land of Egypt whom Asenath the daughter of Potiphera priest of Heliopolis bore for him Manasseh and EphraimThe sons of Benjamin Bela and Becher and Ashbel and Gera and Naaman and Ehi and Rosh and Moppim and Huppim and ArdThese are the sons of Rachel whom she bore to Jacob all these souls are fourteenThe sons of Dan HushimThe sons of Naphtali Jahzeel and Guni and Jezer and ShillemThese are the sons of Bilhah whom Laban gave to his daughter Rachel and these she bore to Jacob all these souls are sevenAll the souls who went into Egypt with Jacob and who went out from his thigh besides the wives of his sons were sixty-sixNow the sons of Joseph who were born to him in the land of Egypt were two souls All the souls of the house of Jacob who went into Egypt were seventyThen he sent Judah ahead of himself to Joseph in order to report to him and so that he would meet him in GoshenAnd when he had arrived there Joseph harnessed his chariot and he went up to meet his father at the same place And seeing him he fell upon his neck and amid embraces he weptAnd the father said to Joseph Now I will die happy because I have seen your face and I am leaving you behind aliveAnd he said to his brothers and to all his fathers house I will go up and report to Pharaoh and I will say to him My brothers and my fathers house who were in the land of Canaan have come to meAnd these honorable men are pastors of sheep and they have the task of feeding the flock Their cattle and herds and all that they were able to hold they have brought with themAnd when he will call you and will say What is your workYou will respond Your servants are pastors of honor from our infancy even to the present time both we and our fathers Now you will say this so that you may be able to live in the land of Goshen because the Egyptians detest all pastors of sheepAnd so Joseph entered and reported to Pharaoh saying My father and brothers their sheep and herds and everything that they possess have arrived from the land of Canaan And behold they stand together in the land of GoshenLikewise he stood in the sight of the king five men the last of his brothersAnd he questioned them What do you have for work They responded Your servants are pastors of sheep both we and our fathersWe came to sojourn in your land because there is no grass for the flocks of your servants the famine being very grievous in the land of Canaan And we petition you that you may order us your servants to be in the land of GoshenAnd so the king said to Joseph Your father and brothers have come to youThe land of Egypt is in your sight Cause them to live in the best place and deliver to them the land of Goshen And if you know there to be industrious men among them appoint these as foremen over my cattleAfter this Joseph brought in his father to the king and he stood him in his sight He blessed himand he questioned him How many are the days of the years of your lifeHe responded The days of my sojourn are one hundred and thirty years few and unworthy and they do not reach even to the days of the sojourning of my fathersAnd blessing the king he went outsideTruly Joseph gave his father and brothers a possession in Egypt in the best place of the land in Rameses as Pharaoh had instructedAnd he fed them along with all his fathers house providing portions of food to each oneFor in the whole world there was a lack of bread and a famine had oppressed the land most of all Egypt and Canaanfrom which he gathered together all the money for the grain that they bought and he took it into the treasury of the kingAnd when the buyers had run out of money all Egypt came to Joseph saying Give us bread Why should we die in your sight lacking moneyAnd he responded to them Bring me your cattle and I will give food to you in exchange for them if you do not have moneyAnd when they had brought them he gave them food for their horses and sheep and oxen and donkeys And he sustained them in that year in exchange for their cattleLikewise they came the second year and they said to him We will not conceal from our lord that our money is gone likewise our cattle are gone Neither are you unaware that we have nothing left but our bodies and our landTherefore why should you watch us die Both we and our land will be yours Buy us into royal servitude but provide seed lest by the dying off of cultivators the land be reduced to a wildernessTherefore Joseph bought all the land of Egypt each one selling his possessions because of the magnitude of the famine And he subjected it to Pharaohalong with all of its people from the newest borders of Egypt even to its furthest limitsexcept the land of the priests which had been delivered to them by the king To these also a portion of food was supplied out of the public storehouses and for this reason they were not compelled to sell their possessionsTherefore Joseph said to the people So as you discern both you and your lands are possessed by Pharaoh take seed and sow the fieldsso that you may be able to have grain One fifth part you will give to the king the remaining four I permit to you as seed and as food for your families and childrenAnd they responded Our health is in your hand only let our lord look kindly upon us and we will serve the king with gladnessFrom that time even to the present day in the entire land of Egypt the fifth part is turned over to the kings and it has become like a law except in the land of the priests which was free from this conditionAnd so Israel lived in Egypt that is in the land of Goshen and he possessed it And he increased and was multiplied exceedinglyAnd he lived in it seventeen years And all the days of his life that passed were one hundred and forty-seven yearsAnd when he discerned that the day of his death was approaching he called his son Joseph and he said to him If I have found favor in your sight place your hand under my thigh And you shall show me mercy and truth not to bury me in EgyptBut I shall sleep with my fathers and you will carry me from this land and bury me in the sepulcher of my ancestors And Joseph answered him I will do what you have orderedAnd he said Then swear it to me And as he was swearing Israel adored God turning to the head of his resting placeAfter these things were done it was reported to Joseph that his father was sick And taking his two sons Manasseh and Ephraim he went directly to himAnd it was told to the old man Behold your son Joseph is coming to you And being strengthened he sat up in bedAnd when he had entered to him he said Almighty God appeared to me at Luz which is in the land of Canaan and he blessed meAnd he said I will increase and multiply you and I will make you influential among the people And I will give this land to you and to your offspring after you as an everlasting possessionTherefore your two sons who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came here to you will be mine Ephraim and Manasseh will be treated by me just like Reuben and SimeonBut the remainder whom you will conceive after them will be yours and they will be called by the name of their brothers among their possessionsAs for me when I came from Mesopotamia Rachel died in the land of Canaan on the very journey and it was springtime And I entered Ephrath and buried her next to the way of Ephrath which by another name is called BethlehemThen seeing his sons he said to him Who are theseHe responded They are my sons whom God gave to me as a gift in this place Bring them to me he said so that I may bless themFor Israels eyes were clouded by reason of his great age and he was unable to see clearly And when they were placed up against him he kissed and embraced themAnd he said to his son I have not been cheated out of seeing you Moreover God has shown me your offspringAnd when Joseph had taken them from his fathers lap he reverenced prone on the groundAnd he placed Ephraim on his right that is towards the left hand of Israel Yet truly Manasseh was on his left namely towards his fathers right hand And he placed them both up against himAnd he extending his right hand placed it over the head of Ephraim the younger brother but the left hand was on the head of Manasseh who was the elder so that his hands were crossedAnd Jacob blessed the sons of Joseph and he said God in whose sight my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked God who pastured me from my youth until the present daythe Angel who rescues me from all evils bless these boys And let my name be invoked over them and also the names of my fathers Abraham and Isaac And may they increase into a multitude across the earthBut Joseph seeing that his father had placed his right hand over the head of Ephraim took it gravely And grasping his fathers hand he tried to lift it from Ephraims head and transfer it onto the head of ManassehAnd he said to his father It should not have come to pass this way father For this one is the firstborn Place your right hand over his headBut refusing he said I know my son I know And this one indeed will be among the people and will be multiplied But his younger brother will be greater than he And his offspring will increase among the nationsAnd he blessed them at that time saying In you Israel will be blessed and it will be said May God treat you like Ephraim and like Manasseh  And he established Ephraim before ManassehAnd he said to his son Joseph See I am dying and God will be with you and he will lead you back to the land of your fathersI give you one part beyond that of your brothers which I took from the hand of the Amorite with my sword and my bowThen Jacob called his sons and he said to them Gather together so that I may announce what will happen to you in the last daysGather together and listen O sons of Jacob Listen to Israel your fatherReuben my firstborn you are my strength and the beginning of my sorrow first in gifts greater in authorityYou are being poured out like water may you not increase For you climbed onto your fathers bed and you defiled his resting placeThe brothers Simeon and Levi vessels of iniquity waging warLet not my soul go by their counsel nor my glory be within their meeting For in their fury they killed a man and in their self-will they undermined a wallCursed be their fury because it was obstinate and their indignation because it was harsh I will divide them in Jacob and I will scatter them in IsraelJudah your brothers will praise you Your hand will be at the necks of your enemies the sons of your father will reverence youJudah is a lions young You have gone up to the prey my son While resting you have lain like a lion And just like a lioness who would rouse himThe scepter from Judah and the leader from his thigh will not be taken away until he who will be sent arrives and he will be the expectation of GentilesTying his young colt to the vineyard and his donkey O my son to the vine he will wash his robe in wine and his cloak in the blood of the grapeHis eyes are more beautiful than wine and his teeth whiter than milkZebulun will live at the seashore and by the outpost of ships reaching as far as SidonIssachar will be a strong donkey reclining between the bordersHe saw that rest would be good and that the land was excellent And so he bent his shoulder to carry and he became a servant under tributeDan will judge his people just like any other tribe in IsraelLet Dan be a snake in the way a viper in the path biting the hooves of horses so that his rider may fall backwardI will wait for your salvation O LordGad being girded will fight before him And he himself will be girded backwardAsher his bread will be fat and he will provide delicacies to the kingsNaphtali is a stag sent forth offering words of eloquent beautyJoseph is a growing son a growing son and stately to behold the daughters run back and forth on the wallBut those who held darts provoked him and they contend with him and they envied himHis bow sits in strength and the bands of his arms and hands have been let loose by the hands of the mighty one of Jacob From there he went forth as a pastor the stone of IsraelThe God of your father will be your helper and the Almighty will bless you with the blessings of heaven above with the blessings of the abyss that lies beneath with the blessings of the breasts and of the wombThe blessings of your father are strengthened by the blessings of his fathers until the desire of the hills of eternity shall arrive May they be at the head of Joseph and at the summit of the Nazarite among his brothersBenjamin is a ravenous wolf in the morning he will eat the prey and in the evening he will divide the spoilAll these are the twelve tribes of Israel These things their father spoke to them and he blessed each one with their proper blessingsAnd he instructed them saying I am being gathered to my people Bury me with my fathers in the double cave which is in the field of Ephron the Hittiteopposite Mamre in the land of Canaan which Abraham bought along with its field from Ephron the Hittite as a possession for burialThere they buried him with his wife Sarah And there Isaac was buried with his wife Rebekah There also Leah lies preservedAnd having finished these commands by which he instructed his sons he drew his feet onto the bed and he passed away And he was gathered to his peopleJoseph realizing this fell upon his fathers face weeping and kissing himAnd he instructed his servant physicians to embalm his father with aromaticsAnd while they were fulfilling his orders forty days passed For this was the method of embalming dead bodies And Egypt wept for him for seventy daysAnd when the time for mourning was fulfilled Joseph spoke to the family of Pharaoh If I have found favor in your sight speak to the ears of PharaohFor my father made me swear saying See I am dying You shall bury me in my sepulcher which I dug for myself in the land of Canaan Therefore I shall go up and bury my father and then returnAnd Pharaoh said to him Go up and bury your father just as he made you swearSo as he went up all the elders of the house of Pharaoh went with him along with every patriarch in the land of Egyptand the house of Joseph with his brothers except their little ones and flocks and also the herds which they left behind in the land of GoshenLikewise he had in his company chariots and horsemen And it became a crowd without restraintAnd they arrived at the threshing place of Atad which is situated beyond the Jordan There they spent seven full days celebrating the funeral rites with a great and vehement lamentationAnd when the inhabitants of the land of Canaan had seen this they said This is a great Lamentation for the Egyptians And for this reason the name of that place was called The Lamentation of EgyptAnd so the sons of Jacob did just as he had instructed themAnd carrying him into the land of Canaan they buried him in the double cave which Abraham had bought along with its field from Ephron the Hittite as a possession for burial opposite MamreAnd Joseph returned into Egypt with his brothers and all those of his company having buried his fatherNow that he was dead his brothers were afraid and they said to one another Perhaps now he may remember the injury that he suffered and requite us for all the evil that we did to himSo they sent a message to him saying Your father instructed us before he diedthat we should say these words to you from him I beg you to forget the wickedness of your brothers and the sin and malice that they practiced against you Likewise we petition you to release the servants of the God of your father from this iniquity Hearing this Joseph weptAnd his brothers went to him And reverencing prostrate on the ground they said We are your servantsAnd he answered them Do not be afraid Are we able to resist the will of GodYou devised evil against me But God turned it into good so that he might exalt me just as you presently discern and so that he might bring about the salvation of many peoplesDo not be afraid I will pasture you and your little ones And he consoled them and he spoke mildly and lenientlyAnd he lived in Egypt with all his fathers house and he survived for one hundred and ten years And he saw the sons of Ephraim to the third generation Likewise the sons of Machir the son of Manasseh were born onto Josephs kneesAfter these things happened he said to his brothers God will visit you after my death and he will make you ascend from this land into the land which he swore to Abraham Isaac and JacobAnd when he had made them swear and had said God will visit you carry my bones with you from this placehe died having completed one hundred and ten years of his life And having been embalmed with aromatics he was laid to rest in a coffin in EgyptThese are the names of the sons of Israel who went into Egypt with Jacob They entered each one with his houseReuben Simeon Levi JudahIssachar Zebulun and BenjaminDan and Naphtali Gad and AsherTherefore all the souls of those who went forth from Jacobs thigh were seventy Now Joseph was in EgyptWhen he had died along with all of his brothers and all of that generationthe sons of Israel increased and they multiplied like seedlings And having been strengthened exceedingly they filled the landMeanwhile there arose a new king over Egypt who was ignorant of JosephAnd he said to his people Behold the people of the sons of Israel are many and they are stronger than we areCome let us wisely oppress them lest they multiply; and if any war should advance against us they may be added to our enemies and having fought against us they might depart from the landAnd so he set over them masters of the works in order to afflict them with burdens And they built for Pharaoh the cities of the tabernacles Pithom and RaamsesAnd the more they oppressed them so much more did they multiply and increaseAnd the Egyptians hated the sons of Israel and they afflicted them and mocked themAnd they led their life directly into bitterness with hard work in clay and brick and with all kinds of servitude so that they were being overwhelmed with the works of the landThen the king of Egypt spoke to the midwives of the Hebrews (one of whom one was called Shiphrah another Puah)instructing them When you will act as a midwife to the Hebrew women and the time of delivery has arrived if it is male put it to death; if it is female retain itBut the midwives feared God and so they did not act according to the precept of the king of Egypt but they kept the males safeAnd summoning them the king said What did you intend to do so that you would save the boysThey responded The Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women For they themselves have the wisdom of a midwife and so they give birth before we can come to themTherefore God acted favorably toward the midwives And the people increased and they were strengthened exceedinglyAnd because the midwives feared God he built houses for themTherefore Pharaoh instructed all his people saying Whatever will be born of the male sex cast it into the river; whatever will be born of the female sex retain itAfter these things a man from the house of Levi went out and he took a wife from his own stockAnd she conceived and bore a son And seeing him to be handsome she hid him for three monthsAnd when she was no longer able to hide him she took a small basket woven of bulrushes and she smeared it with pitch as well as tar And she placed the little infant inside and she laid him in the sedges by the bank of the riverHis sister was standing at a distance and was wondering what would happenThen behold the daughter of Pharaoh descended to wash in the river And her maids walked along the edge of the cove And when she had seen the small basket among the papyruses she sent one of her servants for it And when it was broughtshe opened it; and realizing that within it was a little one crying she took pity on him and she said This is one of the infants of the HebrewsAnd the sister of the boy said to her If you wish I will go and call to you a Hebrew woman who will be able nurse the infantShe responded Go The maid went directly and called her motherAnd the daughter of Pharaoh said to her Take this boy and nurse him for me I will give you your wages The woman took and nursed the boy And when he was mature she delivered him to the daughter of PharaohAnd she adopted him in place of a son and she called his name Moses saying Because I took him from the waterIn those days after Moses had grown up he went out to his brothers And he saw their affliction and an Egyptian man striking a certain one of the Hebrews his brothersAnd when he had looked around this way and that and had seen no one nearby he struck down the Egyptian and hid him in the sandAnd going out the next day he spotted two Hebrews quarrelling violently And he said to him who was causing the injury Why do you strike your neighborBut he responded Who appointed you as leader and judge over us Do you want to kill me just as yesterday you killed the Egyptian Moses was afraid and he said How has this word become knownAnd Pharaoh heard this talk and he sought to kill Moses But fleeing from his sight he stayed in the land of Midian and he sat down next to a wellNow there was a priest of Midian with seven daughters who came to draw water And having filled the troughs they desired to water their fathers flocksThe shepherds overcame them and drove them away And Moses rose up and defending the girls he watered their sheepAnd when they had returned to their father Reuel he said to them Why have you arrived sooner than usualThey responded A man of Egypt freed us from the hands of the shepherds Moreover he also drew water with us and gave the sheep to drinkBut he said Where is he Why have you dismissed the man Call him so that he may eat breadTherefore Moses swore that he would live with him And he accepted his daughter Zipporah as a wifeAnd she bore a son to him whom he called Gershom saying I have been a newcomer in a foreign land In truth she bore another whom he called Eliezer saying For the God of my father my helper has rescued me from the hand of PharaohIn truth after a long time the king of Egypt was dead And the sons of Israel groaning cried out because of the works And their cry ascended to God from the worksAnd he heard their groaning and he also remembered the covenant which he formed with Abraham Isaac and JacobAnd the Lord looked with favor on the sons of Israel and he knew themNow Moses was pasturing the sheep of his father-in-law Jethro a priest of Midian And when he had driven the flock into the interior of the desert he came to the mountain of God HorebAnd the Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire from the midst of a bush And he saw that the bush was burning and was not burntTherefore Moses said I will go and see this great sight why the bush is not burntThen the Lord discerning that he proceeded on to see it called to him from the midst of the bush and he said Moses Moses And he responded Here I amAnd he said Lest you should approach here remove the shoes from your feet For the place on which you stand is holy groundAnd he said I am the God of your father the God of Abraham the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob Moses hid his face for he dared not look directly at GodAnd the Lord said to him I have seen the affliction of my people in Egypt and I have heard their outcry because of the harshness of those who are over the worksAnd knowing their sorrow I have descended in order to free them from the hands of the Egyptians and to lead them from that land into a good and spacious land into a land which flows with milk and honey to the places of the Canaanite and Hittite and Amorite and Perizzite and Hivite and JebusiteAnd so the outcry of the sons of Israel has come to me And I have seen their affliction with which they are oppressed by the EgyptiansBut come and I will send you to Pharaoh so that you may lead my people the sons of Israel out of EgyptAnd Moses said to God Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and that I should lead the sons of Israel out of EgyptAnd he said to him I will be with you And you will have this as a sign that I have sent you When you will have brought my people out of Egypt you will offer sacrifice to God upon this mountainMoses said to God Behold I will go to the sons of Israel and I will say to them The God of your fathers has sent me to you If they say to me What is his name What shall I say to themGod said to Moses I AM WHO AM He said Thus shall you say to the sons of Israel HE WHO IS has sent me to you And God said again to Moses Thus shall you say to the sons of Israel The Lord God of your fathers the God of Abraham the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob has sent me to you This is the name for me in eternity and this is my memorial from generation to generationGo and gather together the elders of Israel and you shall say to them The Lord God of your fathers the God of Abraham the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob has appeared to me saying When visiting I have visited you and I have seen all that has befallen you in EgyptAnd I have spoken in order to lead you out of the affliction of Egypt into the land of the Canaanite and Hittite and Amorite and Perizzite and Hivite and Jebusite into a land flowing with milk and honeyAnd they shall hear your voice And you shall enter you and the elders of Israel to the king of Egypt and you shall say to him The Lord God of the Hebrews has called us We shall go three days journey into the wilderness in order to offer sacrifice to the Lord our GodBut I know that the king of Egypt will not release you unless you go out by a powerful handFor I will extend my hand and I will strike Egypt with all my wonders that I will do in the midst of them After these things he will release youAnd I will grant favor to this people in the sight of the Egyptians And so when you go forth you shall not go out emptyBut every woman shall ask of her neighbor and of her hostess vessels of silver and of gold as well as garments And you shall set them upon your sons and daughters and you shall despoil EgyptResponding Moses said They will not believe me and they will not listen to my voice but they will say The Lord has not appeared to you Therefore he said to him What is that you hold in your hand He answered A staffAnd the Lord said Cast it down upon the ground He cast it down and it was turned into a snake so that Moses fled awayAnd the Lord said Reach out your hand and take hold of its tail He reached out his hand and took hold and it was turned into a staffSo may they believe he said that the Lord God of their fathers the God of Abraham the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob has appeared to youAnd the Lord said again Put your hand into your bosom And when he had put it into his bosom he brought it out leprous resembling snowPut your hand back he said into your bosom He put it back and brought it out again and it was like the rest of his fleshIf they will not believe you he said and will not listen to the sermon of the first sign then they will believe the word of the subsequent signBut if they will not believe even these two signs and they will not listen to your voice take from the water of the river and pour it upon the dry land and whatever you will have drawn from the river will be turned into bloodMoses said I beg you O Lord I was not eloquent yesterday or the day before And from the time that you have spoken to your servant I have a greater impediment and slowness of tongueThe Lord said to him Who made the mouth of man And who has formed the mute and the deaf the seeing and the blind Was it not IGo on therefore and I will be in your mouth And I will teach you what you shall sayBut he said I beg you O Lord send whomever else you would sendThe Lord being angry at Moses said Aaron the Levite is your brother I know that he is eloquent Behold he is going out to meet you and seeing you he will rejoice in heartSpeak to him and put my words in his mouth And I will be in your mouth and in his mouth and I will reveal to you what you must doHe will speak for you to the people and he will be your mouth But you will be with him in those things that pertain to GodAlso take this staff into your hand; with it you will accomplish the signsMoses went forth and he returned to Jethro his father in law and he said to him I shall go and return to my brothers in Egypt so that I may see if they are still alive And Jethro said to him Go in peaceAnd so the Lord said to Moses in Midian Go and return to Egypt For all those who sought your life have diedTherefore Moses took his wife and his sons and he placed them upon a donkey and he returned into Egypt carrying the staff of God in his handAnd the Lord said to him as he was returning to Egypt See that you accomplish in the sight of Pharaoh all the wonders that I have placed in your hand I will harden his heart and he will not release the peopleAnd you shall say to him Thus says the Lord Israel is my firstborn sonI have said to you Release my son so that he may serve me And you were not willing to release him Behold I will put to death your firstborn son And while he was on the journey at an inn the Lord met him and he was willing to kill himFor this reason Zipporah took a very sharp stone and she circumcised the foreskin of her son and she touched his feet and she said You are a bloody spouse to meAnd he released him after she had said You are a bloody spouse because of the circumcisionThen the Lord said to Aaron Go into the desert to meet Moses And he went directly to meet him on the mountain of God and he kissed himAnd Moses explained to Aaron all the words of the Lord by which he had sent him and the signs which he had commandedAnd they arrived at the same time and they gathered together all the elders of the sons of IsraelAnd Aaron spoke all the words which the Lord had said to Moses And he accomplished the signs in the sight of the peopleand the people believed And they heard that the Lord had visited the sons of Israel and that he had looked with favor upon their affliction And falling prostrate they worshipedAfter these things Moses and Aaron entered and they said to Pharaoh Thus says the Lord God of Israel Release my people so that they may sacrifice to me in the desertBut he responded Who is the Lord that I should listen to his voice and release Israel I do not know the Lord and I will not release IsraelAnd they said The God of the Hebrews has called us so that we may go three days journey into the wilderness and sacrifice to the Lord our God Otherwise a pestilence or the sword may befall usThe king of Egypt said to them Why do you Moses and Aaron distract the people from their works Go back to your burdensAnd Pharaoh said The people of the land are many You see that the turmoil has increased how much more if you give them rest from the worksTherefore on the same day he instructed the overseers of the works and the taskmasters of the people sayingYou shall no longer give chaff to the people to form bricks as before But they may go and gather strawAnd you shall impose upon them the same quota of bricks that they made before Neither will you lessen anything for they are idle and therefore they cry out saying We shall go and sacrifice to our GodThey shall be oppressed with works and these shall occupy them so that they may not agree to lying wordsAnd so the overseers of the works and the taskmasters went out and said to the people Thus says Pharaoh I give you no chaffGo and collect it wherever you are able to find it Neither will anything of your work be diminishedAnd the people were dispersed through all the land of Egypt in order to gather strawLikewise the overseers of the works pressured them saying Complete your work each day just as you were accustomed to do before when straw was given to youAnd those who were first in the works of the sons of Israel were scourged by Pharaohs taskmasters saying Why have you not filled the quota of bricks neither yesterday nor today just as beforeAnd the first among the sons of Israel came and they cried out to Pharaoh saying Why do act against your servants in this wayStraw is not given to us and yet the same amount of bricks is commanded So we your servants are cut up by scourging and injustice is done against your peopleAnd he said You are idle And for this reason you say We shall go and sacrifice to the LordTherefore go and work Straw will not be given to you and you will return the customary number of bricksAnd the first among the sons of Israel saw themselves in a crisis because it was said to them Nothing at all will be lessened from the bricks throughout each dayAnd they met with Moses and Aaron who stood opposite them as they departed from PharaohAnd they said to them May the Lord see and judge because you have caused our odor to become foul before Pharaoh and his servants and you have provided him with a sword in order to kill usAnd Moses returned to the Lord and he said Lord why have you afflicted this people Why have you sent meFor from the time that I entered to Pharaoh so as to speak in your name he has afflicted your people And you have not freed themAnd the Lord said to Moses Now you will see what I shall do to Pharaoh For through a strong hand he will release them and by a mighty hand he will cast them from his landAnd the Lord spoke to Moses saying I am the Lordwho appeared to Abraham to Isaac and to Jacob as Almighty God And I did not reveal to them my name ADONAIAnd I formed a covenant with them in order to give them the land of Canaan the land of their sojourning in which they were newcomersI have heard the groaning of the sons of Israel with which the Egyptians have oppressed them And I have remembered my covenantFor this reason say to the sons of Israel I am the Lord who will lead you away from the work house of the Egyptians and rescue you from servitude and also redeem you with an exalted arm and great judgmentsAnd I will take you to myself as my people and I will be your God And you will know that I am the Lord your God who led you away from the work house of the Egyptiansand who brought you into the land over which I lifted up my hand in order to grant it to Abraham Isaac and Jacob And I will grant it to you as a possession I am the LordAnd so Moses explained all these things to the sons of Israel who did not agree with him because of their anguish of spirit and very difficult workAnd the Lord spoke to Moses sayingEnter and speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt so that he may release the sons of Israel from his landMoses responded in the sight the Lord Behold the sons of Israel do not listen to me And how will Pharaoh listen to me especially since I am of uncircumcised lipsAnd the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron and he gave them a commandment for the sons of Israel and for Pharaoh the king of Egypt that they should lead the sons of Israel away from the land of EgyptThese are the leaders of the houses by their families The sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel Hanoch and Pallu Hezron and CarmiThese are the kindred of Reuben The sons of Simeon Jemuel and Jamin and Ohad and Jachin and Zohar and Shaul the son of a Canaanite women These are the progeny of SimeonAnd these are the names of the sons of Levi by their kindred Gershon and Kohath and Merari Now the years of the life of Levi were one hundred and thirty-sevenThe sons of Gershon Libni and Shimei by their kindredThe sons of Kohath Amram and Izhar and Hebron and Uzziel Likewise the years of the life of Kohath were one hundred and thirty-threeThe sons of Merari Mahli and Mushi These are the kindred of Levi by their familiesNow Amram took as a wife Jochebed his paternal aunt who bore for him Aaron and Moses And the years of the life of Amram were one hundred and thirty-sevenLikewise the sons of Izhar Korah and Nepheg and ZichriLikewise the sons of Uzziel Mishael and Elzaphan and SithriNow Aaron took as a wife Elizabeth the daughter of Amminadab sister of Nahshon who bore for him Nadab and Abihu and Eleazar and IthamarLikewise the sons of Korah Assir and Elkanah and Abiasaph These are the kindred of the KorahitesAnd truly Eleazar the son of Aaron took a wife from the daughters of Putiel And she bore him Phinehas These are the heads of the Levitical families by their kindredThese are Aaron and Moses whom the Lord instructed to lead the sons of Israel away from the land of Egypt by their companiesThese are those who speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt in order to lead the sons of Israel out of Egypt These are Moses and Aaronin the day when the Lord spoke to Moses in the land of EgyptAnd the Lord spoke to Moses saying I am the Lord Speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I speak to youAnd Moses said in the sight of the Lord Lo I am of uncircumcised lips how will Pharaoh listen to meAnd the Lord said to Moses Behold I have appointed you as the god of Pharaoh And Aaron your brother will be your prophetYou will speak to him all that I command you And he will speak to Pharaoh so that he may release the sons of Israel from his landBut I will harden his heart and I will multiply my signs and wonders in the land of Egyptand he will not listen to you And I will send my hand over Egypt and I will lead my army and my people the sons of Israel from the land of Egypt through very great judgmentsAnd the Egyptians will know that I am the Lord who has extended my hand over Egypt and who has led the sons of Israel from their midstAnd so Moses and Aaron did just as the Lord had instructed And so it was doneNow Moses was eighty years old and Aaron eighty-three when they spoke to PharaohAnd the Lord said to Moses and AaronWhen Pharaoh will say to you Show signs you shall say to Aaron Take your staff and cast it down before Pharaoh and it will be turned into a snake And so Moses and Aaron entered to Pharaoh and they did just as the Lord had commanded And Aaron took the staff in the sight of Pharaoh and his servants and it was turned into a snakeThen Pharaoh called the wise men and the sorcerers And they also by Egyptian incantations and certain secrets did similarlyAnd each one cast down their staffs and they were turned into serpents But the staff of Aaron devoured their staffsAnd the heart of Pharaoh was hardened and he did not listen to them just as the Lord had instructedThen the Lord said to Moses The heart of Pharaoh has been hardened; he is not willing to release the peopleGo to him in the morning; behold he will go out to the waters And you will stand to meet him above the bank of the river And you will take in your hand the staff that was turned into a serpentAnd you will say to him The Lord God of the Hebrews sent me to you saying Release my people in order to sacrifice to me in the desert And even until the present time you were not willing to listenTherefore thus says the Lord In this you will know that I am the Lord Behold I will strike with the staff that is in my hand the water of the river and it will be turned into bloodAlso the fishes that are in the river will die and the waters will be polluted and the Egyptians will be afflicted when they drink the water of the river The Lord also said to Moses Say to Aaron Take your staff; and extend your hand over the waters of Egypt and over their rivers and streams and marshes and all the pools of waters so that they may be turned into blood And let there be blood throughout all the land of Egypt as much in vessels of wood as in those of stone And Moses and Aaron did just as the Lord had instructed And lifting up the staff he struck the water of the river in the sight of Pharaoh and his servants And it was turned into bloodAnd the fishes that were in the river died and the river was polluted and the Egyptians were not able to drink the water of the river and there was blood throughout the entire land of EgyptAnd the sorcerers of the Egyptians with their incantations did similarly And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened he did not listen to them just as the Lord had instructedAnd he turned himself away and he entered his house neither did he apply his heart to this turn of eventsThen all the Egyptians dug along the borders of the river for water to drink For they were not able to drink from the water of the riverAnd seven days were completed after the Lord struck the riverThe Lord also said to Moses Enter to Pharaoh and you will say to him Thus says the Lord Release my people in order to sacrifice to meBut if you are not willing to release them behold I will strike all your coasts with frogsAnd the river will seethe with frogs which will go up and enter into your house and your bedroom and upon your bed and into the houses of your servants and your people and into your ovens and into the remains of your foodsAnd to you and to your people and to all your servants the frogs will enter And the Lord said to Moses Say to Aaron Extend your hand over the rivers and also over the streams and the marshes and bring forth frogs over the land of Egypt And Aaron extended his hand over the waters of Egypt and the frogs came up and covered the land of EgyptThen the sorcerers also by their incantations did similarly and they brought forth frogs upon the land of EgyptBut Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron and he said to them Pray to the Lord so as to take away the frogs from me and from my people And I will release the people so as to sacrifice to the LordAnd Moses said to Pharaoh Appoint for me a time when I should petition on behalf of you and your servants and your people so that the frogs may be driven away from you and from your house and from your servants and from your people and so that they may remain only in the riverAnd he responded Tomorrow Then he said I will act according to your word so that you may know that there is no one like the Lord our GodAnd the frogs will withdraw from you and from your house and from your servants and from your people And they will remain only in the riverAnd Moses and Aaron departed from Pharaoh And Moses cried out to the Lord on behalf of the promise that he had made to Pharaoh concerning the frogsAnd the Lord acted according to the word of Moses And the frogs died out of the houses and out of the villages and out of the fieldsAnd they gathered them together into immense piles and the land was pollutedThen Pharaoh seeing that relief had been provided hardened his own heart and he did not listen to them just as the Lord had instructedAnd the Lord said to Moses Say to Aaron Extend your staff and strike the dust of the earth And let there be stinging insects throughout the entire the land of Egypt And they did so And Aaron extended his hand holding the staff and he struck the dust of the earth and there came stinging insects upon men and upon beasts All the dust of the earth was turned into stinging insects through all the land of EgyptAnd the sorcerers with their incantations did similarly in order to bring forth stinging insects but they were not able And there were stinging insects as much on men as on beastsAnd the sorcerers said to Pharaoh This is the finger of God And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened and he did not listen to them just as the Lord had instructedThe Lord also said to Moses Arise at first light and stand in the sight of Pharaoh for he will go out to the waters And you will say to him Thus says the Lord Release my people to sacrifice to meBut if you will not release them behold I will send upon you and upon your servants and upon your people and into your houses diverse kinds of flies And the houses of the Egyptians will be filled with diverse kinds of flies as well as the whole land in which they will beAnd in that day I will cause a miracle in the land of Goshen where my people are so that flies will not be there And you will know that I am the Lord in the midst of the earthAnd I will set a division between my people and your people Tomorrow this sign will be And the Lord did so And there came very grievous flies into the houses of Pharaoh and of his servants and into all the land of Egypt And the land was polluted in this way by the fliesAnd Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron and he said to them Go and sacrifice to your God in this landAnd Moses said It cannot be so For we will immolate the abominations of the Egyptians to the Lord our God For if we slaughter those things which the Egyptians worship in their presence they will stone usWe will sojourn three days journey into the wilderness And we will sacrifice to the Lord our God just as he has instructed usAnd Pharaoh said I will release you in order to sacrifice to the Lord your God in the desert Yet you may only go so far Petition for meAnd Moses said After departing from you I will pray to the Lord And the flies will withdraw from Pharaoh and from his servants and from his people tomorrow Yet do not be willing to deceive any longer so that you would not release the people to sacrifice to the LordAnd Moses departing from Pharaoh prayed to the LordAnd he acted according to his word And he took away the flies from Pharaoh and from his servants and from his people There was not even one left behindAnd the heart of Pharaoh was hardened so that even at this turn he would not release the peopleThen the Lord said to Moses Enter to Pharaoh and say to him Thus says the Lord God of the Hebrews Release my people to sacrifice to meBut if you still refuse and you retain thembehold my hand will be over your fields And a very grievous pestilence will be upon the horses and the donkeys and the camels and the oxen and the sheepAnd the Lord will cause a miracle between the possessions of Israel and the possessions of the Egyptians so that nothing at all will perish from those things which belong to the sons of IsraelAnd the Lord appointed a time saying Tomorrow the Lord will accomplish this word in the landTherefore the Lord accomplished this word the next day And all the animals of the Egyptians died Yet truly of the animals of the sons of Israel nothing at all perishedAnd Pharaoh sent to see; neither was there anything dead of those things that Israel possessed And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened and he did not release the peopleAnd the Lord said to Moses and to Aaron Take handfuls of ashes from the oven and let Moses sprinkle it into the air in the sight of PharaohAnd let there be dust upon all the land of Egypt For there will be sores and swelling pustules on men and on beasts throughout the entire land of EgyptAnd they took ashes from the oven and they stood in the sight of Pharaoh and Moses sprinkled it in the air And there came sores with swelling pustules on men and on beastsNeither could the sorcerers stand in the sight of Moses because of the sores that were on them and on all the land of EgyptAnd the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh and he did not listen to them just as the Lord said to MosesAnd the Lord said to Moses Rise up in the morning and stand in the sight of Pharaoh and you will say to him Thus says the Lord God of the Hebrews Release my people to sacrifice to meFor at this turn I will send all my plagues upon your heart and upon your servants and upon your people So may you know that there is no one like me in all the earthFor now extending my hand I shall strike you and your people with pestilence and you will perish from the earthBut it was for this reason that I appointed you so that I may reveal my strength by you and so that my name may be described throughout all the earthDo you still retain my people and are you still unwilling to release themSo then tomorrow at this same hour I will rain down exceedingly great hail such as has not been in Egypt from the day that it was founded even until this present timeTherefore send immediately and gather together your cattle and all that you have in the field For men and beasts and all things that will be found outside not gathered in from the fields and on which the hail will fall shall die He who feared the word of the Lord among the servants of Pharaoh caused his servants and cattle to flee together into the housesBut he who neglected the word of the Lord released his servants and cattle into the fieldsAnd the Lord said to Moses Extend your hand into the sky so that there may be hail in the entire land of Egypt on men and on beasts and on every plant of the field in the land of EgyptAnd Moses extended his staff into the sky and the Lord sent thunder and hail and also lightning dashing across the earth And the Lord rained down hail upon the land of EgyptAnd the hail and intermingled fire drove on together And it was of such magnitude as had never before been seen in the entire land of Egypt from the time when that nation was formedAnd the hail struck throughout all the land of Egypt everything that was in the fields from man even to beast And the hail struck down every plant of the field and it broke every tree of the regionOnly in the land of Goshen where the sons of Israel were did the hail not fallAnd Pharaoh sent and called Moses and Aaron saying to them I have sinned even until now The Lord is just I and my people are impiousPray to the Lord so that the thundering of God and the hail may cease so that I may release you and so that you may by no means remain here any longerMoses said When I have departed from the city I will extend my hands to the Lord and the thunders will cease and the hail will not be so that you may know that the earth belongs to the LordBut I know that both you and your servants do not yet fear the Lord GodAnd so the flax and the barley were damaged because the barley was growing and the flax was already developing grainsBut the wheat and the spelt were not damaged because they were lateAnd Moses departing from Pharaoh out of the city reached out his hands toward the Lord And the thunders and hail ceased neither did there drop any more rain upon the landThen Pharaoh seeing that the rain and the hail and the thunders had ceased added to his sinAnd his heart was weighed down along with that of his servants and it was hardened exceedingly Neither did he release the sons of Israel just as the Lord had instructed by the hand of MosesAnd the Lord said to Moses Enter to Pharaoh For I have hardened his heart and that of his servants so that I may accomplish these my signs in himand so that you may describe to the ears of your sons and your grandsons how often I opposed the Egyptians and wrought my signs among them and so that you may know that I am the LordTherefore Moses and Aaron entered to Pharaoh and they said to him Thus says the Lord God of the Hebrews How long will you be unwilling to be subject to me Release my people to sacrifice to meBut if you resist and you are unwilling to release them behold tomorrow I will bring locusts into your bordersAnd they shall cover the face of the earth lest any part of it be seen Yes and what remains from the hail shall be eaten For they will gnaw away all the trees that spring up in the fieldsAnd they will fill your houses and those of your servants and of all the Egyptians so many as your fathers and ancestors have not seen from the time that they rose up over the earth even until this present day And he turned himself away and he departed from PharaohThen the servants of Pharaoh said to him How long must we endure this scandal Release the men in order to sacrifice to the Lord their God Do you not see that Egypt is perishingAnd they called back Moses and Aaron to Pharaoh who said to them Go sacrifice to the Lord your God Who are they who would goMoses said We will travel with our little ones and our elderly with our sons and daughters with our sheep and herds For it is a solemnity of the Lord our GodAnd Pharaoh responded So let the Lord be with you But if I were to release you and your little ones who would doubt that you intend some great wickednessIt will not be so However go only with the men and sacrifice to the Lord For this too is what you yourselves requested And immediately they were cast out from the sight of PharaohThen the Lord said to Moses Extend your hand over the land of Egypt toward the locusts so that they may rise up over it and devour every plant which remains from the hailAnd Moses extended his staff over the land of Egypt And the Lord brought a burning wind all that day and night And when morning came the burning wind lifted up the locustsAnd they ascended over the entire land of Egypt And they settled into all the parts of the Egyptians innumerable such as had not been before that time nor ever would be thereafterAnd they covered the entire face of the land laying waste to all things And the plants of the land were devoured along with whatever fruits were on the trees which the hail had left behind And nothing at all of the greenery remained on the trees or on the plants of the earth in all of EgyptFor this reason Pharaoh hurriedly called Moses and Aaron and he said to them I have sinned against the Lord your God and against youBut now release me from my sin even this time and petition the Lord your God so that he may take this death away from meAnd Moses departing from the sight of Pharaoh prayed to the LordAnd he caused a very strong wind to blow from the west and seizing the locusts it cast them into the Red Sea There remained not so much as one in all the parts of EgyptAnd the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh; neither did he release the sons of IsraelThen the Lord said to Moses Extend your hand into the sky And let there be a darkness over the land of Egypt so dense that they may be able to feel itAnd Moses extended his hand into the sky And there came a horrible darkness in the entire land of Egypt for three daysNo one saw his brother nor moved himself out of the place where he was But wherever the sons of Israel were living there was lightAnd Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron and he said to them Go sacrifice to the Lord Only let your sheep and herds remain behind Your little ones may go with youMoses said You must also permit us victims and holocausts which we may offer to the Lord our GodAll the flocks shall travel with us Not one hoof of them shall remain behind For they are necessary for the worship of the Lord our God especially since we do not know what ought to be immolated until we arrive at the very placeBut the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh and he was not willing to release themAnd Pharaoh said to Moses Withdraw from me and beware that you no longer see my face On whatever day you will appear in my sight you shall dieMoses responded So be it just as you have said I will no longer see your faceAnd the Lord said to Moses I will touch Pharaoh and Egypt with one more plague and after these things he will release you and he will compel you to go outTherefore you will tell all the people to ask a man of his friend and a woman of her neighbor for vessels of silver and of goldThen the Lord will grant favor to his people in the sight of the Egyptians And Moses was a very great man in the land of Egypt in the sight of the servants of Pharaoh and of all the peopleAnd he said Thus says the Lord In the middle of the night I will enter into EgyptAnd every firstborn in the land of the Egyptians shall die from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sits on his throne even to the firstborn of the handmaid who is at the millstone and all the firstborn of the beasts of burdenAnd there will be a great outcry throughout the entire land of Egypt such as has not been before nor ever will be afterwardBut among all the sons of Israel there shall not be even a mutter from a dog from man even to cattle so that you may know how miraculously the Lord divides the Egyptians from IsraelAnd all these your servants shall descend to me and shall reverence me by saying Depart you and all the people who are subject to you After these things we will departAnd he went out from Pharaoh exceedingly angry Then the Lord said to Moses Pharaoh will not listen to you so that many signs may be accomplished in the land of EgyptNow Moses and Aaron did all the wonders that are written in the sight of Pharaoh And the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh; neither did he release the sons of Israel from his landThe Lord also said to Moses and Aaron in the land of EgyptThis month will be for you the beginning of the months It will be first in the months of the yearSpeak to the entire assembly of the sons of Israel and say to them On the tenth day of this month let everyone take a lamb by their families and housesBut if the number is less than may suffice to be able to consume the lamb he shall accept his neighbor who has been joined with his house according to the number of souls that may suffice to be able to eat the lambAnd it shall be a lamb without blemish a one year old male According to this rite you shall also take a young goatAnd you shall keep it until the fourteenth day of this month And the entire multitude of the sons of Israel shall immolate it toward eveningAnd they shall take from its blood and place it on both the door posts and the upper threshold of the houses in which they will consume itAnd that night they shall eat the flesh roasted by fire and unleavened bread with wild lettuceYou shall not consume anything from it raw nor boiled in water but only roasted by fire You shall devour the head with its feet and entrailsNeither shall there remain anything from it until morning If anything will have been left over you shall burn it with fireNow you shall consume it in this way You shall gird your waist and you shall have shoes on your feet holding staves in your hands and you shall consume it in haste For it is the Passover (that is the Crossing) of the LordAnd I will cross through the land of Egypt that night and I will strike down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt from man even to cattle And I will bring judgments against all the gods of Egypt I am the LordBut the blood will be for you as a sign in the buildings where you will be And I will see the blood and I will pass over you And the plague will not be with you to destroy when I strike the land of EgyptThen you shall have this day as a memorial and you shall celebrate it as a solemnity to the Lord in your generations as an everlasting devotionFor seven days you shall eat unleavened bread On the first day there shall be no leaven in your houses Whoever will consume anything leavened from the first day even until the seventh day that soul shall perish from IsraelThe first day shall be holy and solemn and the seventh day shall be venerated with the same festivity You shall do no work in these days except that which pertains to the eatingAnd you shall observe the feast of unleavened bread For on this same day I will lead your army out of the land of Egypt and you shall keep this day in your generations as a perpetual ritualIn the first month on the fourteenth day of the month toward evening you shall consume the unleavened bread until the twenty-first day of the same month toward eveningFor seven days there shall not be found leaven in your houses Whoever will eat leaven his soul will perish from the assembly of Israel as much with the newcomers as with the natives of the landYou shall not consume any leaven In all your dwelling places you shall eat unleavened breadThen Moses called all the elders of the sons of Israel and he said to them Go taking an animal by your families and sacrifice the PassoverAnd dip a little bundle of hyssop in the blood which is at the entrance and sprinkle the upper threshold with it and both of the door posts Let none of you go out of the door of his house until morningFor the Lord will cross through striking the Egyptians And when he will see the blood on the upper threshold and on both the door posts he will pass over the door of the house and not permit the Striker to enter into your houses or to do harmYou shall keep this word as a law for you and for your sons foreverAnd when you have entered into the land that the Lord will give to you just as he has promised you shall observe these ceremoniesAnd when your sons will say to you What is the meaning of this religious observanceYou shall say to them It is the victim of the crossing of the Lord when he passed over the houses of the sons of Israel in Egypt striking the Egyptians and freeing our houses  And the people bowing down worshippedAnd the sons of Israel departing did just as the Lord had instructed Moses and AaronThen it happened in the middle of the night the Lord struck down every firstborn in the land of Egypt from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sits on his throne even to the firstborn of the captive woman who was in prison and all the firstborn of the cattleAnd Pharaoh rose up in the night and all his servants and all of Egypt And there arose a great outcry in Egypt For there was not a house in which no one lay deadAnd Pharaoh calling Moses and Aaron in the night said Rise up and go forth from among my people you and the sons of Israel Go sacrifice to the Lord just as you sayYour sheep and herds take along with you as you requested and as you go away bless meAnd the Egyptians urged the people to go away from the land quickly saying We will all dieTherefore the people took bread dough before it was leavened And tying it in their cloaks they placed it on their shouldersAnd the sons of Israel did just as Moses had instructed And they petitioned the Egyptians for vessels of silver and of gold and very many garmentsThen the Lord granted favor to the people in the sight of the Egyptians so that they bestowed on them And they despoiled the EgyptiansAnd the sons of Israel set out from Rameses to Soccoth about six hundred thousand men on foot besides little onesBut also an innumerable mix of common people ascended with them sheep and herds and animals of diverse kinds exceedingly manyAnd they baked the bread which a little while ago they had taken out of Egypt as dough And they made unleavened bread baked under ashes For it was not able to be leavened with the Egyptians compelling them to leave and not permitting them to cause any delay Neither did they have occasion to prepare any meatNow the habitation of the sons of Israel while they remained in Egypt was four hundred and thirty yearsHaving been completed on the same day all the army of the Lord departed from the land of EgyptThis night is a worthy observance of the Lord when he led them out of the land of Egypt This all the sons of Israel must observe in their generationsAnd the Lord said to Moses and to Aaron This is the religious observance of the Passover No foreigner shall eat from itBut every bought servant shall be circumcised and so he may eat from itThe newcomer and the hired hand shall not eat from itIn one house it shall be eaten; you shall not carry its flesh outside nor shall you break its boneThe entire assembly of the sons of Israel shall do thisAnd if any sojourner will be willing to cross over into your settlement and to keep the Passover of the Lord all his males shall first be circumcised and then he shall celebrate the rite And he shall be just like a native of the land But if any man is not circumcised he shall not eat from itThe law shall be the same for the native born and for the settler who sojourns with youAnd all the sons of Israel did just as the Lord had instructed Moses and AaronAnd on the same day the Lord led the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their companiesAnd the Lord spoke to Moses sayingSanctify to me every firstborn which opens the womb among the sons of Israel as much of men as of cattle For they are all mineAnd Moses said to the people Remember this day on which you were taken away from Egypt and from the house of servitude For with a strong hand the Lord has led you away from this place Thus you shall eat no leavened breadToday you go forth in the month of new grainAnd when the Lord has brought you into the land of the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Amorite and the Hivite and the Jebusite which he swore to your fathers that he would give to you a land flowing with milk and honey you will celebrate this manner of sacred rites in this monthFor seven days you shall feed on unleavened bread And on the seventh day it will be the solemnity of the LordYou shall consume unleavened bread for seven days There shall not be seen anything leavened with you nor in all your partsAnd you will explain to your son in that day saying This is what the Lord did for me when I was taken away from EgyptAnd it will be like a sign in your hand and like a memorial before your eyes And so may the law of the Lord be always in your mouth For with a strong hand the Lord led you away from the land of EgyptYou will keep this observance at the established time from day to dayAnd when the Lord has brought you into the land of the Canaanite just as he swore to you and to your fathers and when he will give it youthen you shall set aside for the Lord all that opens the womb and all that is first to go forth among your cattle Whatever you will have of the male sex you shall consecrate to the LordThe firstborn of a donkey you will exchange for a sheep And if you will not redeem it you shall put it to death But every firstborn of man among your sons you shall redeem with a priceAnd when your son will question you tomorrow saying What is this you will respond With a strong hand the Lord led us away from the land of Egypt from the house of servitudeFor when Pharaoh had been hardened and was unwilling to release us the Lord killed every firstborn in the land of Egypt from the firstborn of man even to the firstborn of beasts For this reason I immolate to the Lord all of the male sex that opens the womb and all the firstborn of my sons I redeemTherefore it will be like a sign in your hand and like something hanging between your eyes as a remembrance because with a strong hand the Lord has led us away from EgyptAnd so when Pharaoh had sent the people away God did not lead them by the way of the land of the Philistines which is nearby considering that perhaps they might relapse if they saw wars rise up against them and then they might return to EgyptBut he led them around by the way of the desert which is next to the Red Sea And so the sons of Israel ascended armed out of the land of EgyptAlso Moses took the bones of Joseph with him because he had sworn to the sons of Israel saying God will visit you Carry my bones away from here with youAnd setting out from Soccoth they encamped at Etham in the most distant parts of the wildernessNow the Lord preceded them to show them the way by day with a pillar of cloud and by night with a pillar of fire so that he might be the leader of their journey at both timesThese never failed a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night in the sight of the peopleThen the Lord spoke to Moses sayingSpeak to the sons of Israel Let them turn back and encamp away from the region of Pihahiroth which is between Migdol and the sea opposite Baal-zephon In its sight you shall place your camp above the seaAnd Pharaoh will say about the sons of Israel They have been confined by the land; the desert has enclosed themAnd I will harden his heart and so he will pursue you And I will be glorified in Pharaoh and in all his army And the Egyptians will know that I am the Lord And they did soAnd it was reported to the king of the Egyptians that the people had fled And the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was changed about the people and they said What did we intend to do so that we released Israel from serving usTherefore he harnessed his chariot and he took all his people with himAnd he took six hundred chosen chariots and whatever chariots were in Egypt and also the leaders of the whole armyAnd the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt and he pursued the sons of Israel But they were taken away by an exalted handAnd when the Egyptians followed the footsteps of those who preceded them they found them in a camp above the sea All the horses and chariots of Pharaoh and the entire army were in Pihahiroth opposite Baal-zephonAnd when Pharaoh had drawn near the sons of Israel lifting up their eyes saw the Egyptians behind them And they were very afraid And they cried out to the LordAnd they said to Moses Perhaps there were no graves in Egypt for which reason you took us to die in the wilderness What is it that you intended to do in leading us out of EgyptIs this not the word that we spoke to you in Egypt saying Withdraw from us so that we may serve the Egyptians For it was much better to serve them than to die in the wildernessAnd Moses said to the people Do not be afraid Stand firm and see the great wonders of the Lord which he will do today For the Egyptians whom you now see will never again be seen foreverThe Lord will fight on your behalf and you will remain silentAnd the Lord said to Moses Why cry out to me Tell the sons of Israel to continue onNow lift up your staff and extend your hand over the sea and divide it so that the sons of Israel may walk through the midst of the sea on dry groundThen I will harden the heart of the Egyptians so as to pursue you And I will be glorified in Pharaoh and in all his army and in his chariots and in his horsemenAnd the Egyptians will know that I am the Lord when I will be glorified in Pharaoh and in his chariots as well as in his horsemenAnd the Angel of God who preceded the camp of Israel lifting himself up went behind them And the pillar of cloud together with him left the front for the rearand stood between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel And it was a dark cloud yet it illuminated the night so that they could not succeed at approaching one another at any time all that nightAnd when Moses had extended his hand over the sea the Lord took it away by an intense burning wind blowing throughout the night and he turned it into dry ground And the water was dividedAnd the sons of Israel went in through the midst of the dried sea For the water was like a wall at their right hand and at their left handAnd the Egyptians pursuing them went in after them along with all of the horses of Pharaoh his chariots and horsemen through the midst of the seaAnd now the morning watch had arrived and behold the Lord looking down upon the camp of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of cloud put to death their armyAnd he overturned the wheels of the chariots and they were carried into the deep Therefore the Egyptians said Let us flee from Israel For the Lord fights on their behalf against usAnd the Lord said to Moses Extend your hand over the sea so that the waters may return on the Egyptians over their chariots and horsemenAnd when Moses had extended his hand opposite the sea it was returned at first light to its former place And the fleeing Egyptians met with the waters and the Lord immersed them in the midst of the wavesAnd the waters were returned and they covered the chariots and horsemen of the entire army of Pharaoh who in following had entered into the sea And not so much as one of them was left aliveBut the sons of Israel continued directly through the midst of the dried sea and the waters were to them like a wall on the right and on the leftAnd so the Lord freed Israel on that day from the hand of the EgyptiansAnd they saw the Egyptians dead on the shore of the sea and the great hand that the Lord had exercised against them And the people feared the Lord and they believed in the Lord and in Moses his servantThen Moses and the sons of Israel sang this song to the Lord and they said Let us sing to the Lord for he has been gloriously magnified the horse and the rider he has cast into the seaThe Lord is my strength and my praise and he has become my salvation He is my God and I shall glorify him He is the God of my father and I shall exalt himThe Lord is like a fighting man Almighty is his nameThe chariots of Pharaoh and his army he has cast into the sea; his elect leaders have been submerged in the Red SeaThe abyss has covered them They descended into the depths like a stoneYour right hand O Lord has been magnified in strength Your right hand O Lord has struck down the enemyAnd in the multitude of your glory you have put down your adversaries You sent out your wrath which devoured them like stubbleAnd by the breath of your fury the waters were gathered together The flowing waves stood still The abyss was gathered into the midst of the seaThe enemy said I will pursue and overtake them I will divide the spoils My soul will be filled I will unsheathe my sword My hand will put them to deathYour breath blew and the sea covered them They were submerged like lead into the mighty watersWho is like you in strength O Lord Who is like you magnificent in sanctity terrible and yet praiseworthy accomplishing miraclesYou extended your hand and the earth devoured themIn your mercy you have been a leader to the people whom you have redeemed And in your strength you have carried them to your holy dwelling placePeoples rose up and became angry Sorrows took hold of the inhabitants of PhilistiaThen the leaders of Edom were stirred up and trembling took hold of the robust of Moab All the inhabitants of Canaan were petrifiedLet fear and dread fall upon them by the magnitude of your arm Let them become immobilized like stone until your people cross through O Lord until this your people whom you possess cross throughYou shall lead them in and plant them on the mountain of your inheritance in your most firm dwelling place which you have formed O Lord your sanctuary O Lord which your hands have made firmThe Lord will reign in eternity and beyondFor the rider Pharaoh with his chariots and horsemen was brought into the sea And the Lord brought back upon them the waters of the sea But the sons of Israel walked across dry ground in its midstAnd so Miriam the prophetess the sister of Aaron took up a timbrel in her hand And all the women followed her with timbrels and dancingAnd she prophesied saying Let us sing to the Lord for he has been gloriously magnified The horse and its rider he has thrown into the seaThen Moses took Israel from the Red Sea and they went forth into the desert of Shur And they wandered for three days through the wilderness and they found no waterAnd they arrived at Marah They were unable to drink the waters of Marah because they were bitter Therefore he also established a name befitting the place calling it Marah that is bitternessAnd the people murmured against Moses saying What shall we drinkSo he cried out to the Lord who showed him a tree And when he had cast it into the waters they were turned into sweetness In that place he established instructions for him and also judgments And he tested him theresaying If you will listen to the voice of the Lord your God and do what is right in his sight and obey his commands and keep all his precepts I will not bring upon you any of the distress that I imposed on Egypt For I am the Lord your healerThen the sons of Israel arrived in Elim where there were twelve fountains of water and seventy palm trees And they camped next to the watersAnd they set out from Elim And the entire multitude of the sons of Israel arrived at the desert of Sin which is between Elim and Sinai on the fifteenth day of the second month after they departed from the land of EgyptAnd the entire congregation of the sons of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wildernessAnd the sons of Israel said to them If only we had died by the hand of the Lord in the land of Egypt when we sat around bowls of meat and ate bread until filled Why have you led us away into this desert so that you might kill the entire multitude with famineThen the Lord said to Moses Behold I will rain down bread from heaven for you Let the people go out and collect what is sufficient for each day so that I may test them as to whether or not they will walk in my lawBut on the sixth day let them prepare what they use for carrying and let there be double what they were accustomed to collect on a single dayAnd Moses and Aaron said to the sons of Israel In the evening you will know that the Lord has led you away from the land of EgyptAnd in the morning you will see the glory of the Lord For he has heard your murmuring against the Lord But as for us truly what are we that you would whisper against usAnd Moses said In the evening the Lord will give you flesh to eat and in the morning bread in fullness For he has heard your murmurings that you have murmured against him For what are we Your murmuring is not against us but against the LordMoses also said to Aaron Say to the whole congregation of the sons of Israel Approach before the Lord For he has heard your murmuring And when Aaron spoke to the entire assembly of the sons of Israel they looked out toward the wilderness And behold the glory of the Lord appeared in a cloudThen the Lord spoke to Moses sayingI have heard the murmuring of the sons of Israel Say to them In the evening you will eat flesh and in the morning you will be filled with bread And you shall know that I am the Lord your God Therefore it happened in the evening quails rising up covered the camp Likewise in the morning a dew lay all around the campAnd when it had covered the face of the earth it appeared in the wilderness small and as if crushed with a pestle similar to hoar-frost on the groundWhen the sons of Israel had seen it they said one to another Manhu which means What is this For they did not know what it was And Moses said to them This is the bread that the Lord has given you to eatThis is the word that the Lord has instructed Let each one collect as much of it as is sufficient to eat One omer for each head According to the number of your souls which live in a tent so will you take of itAnd the sons of Israel did so And they collected some more others lessAnd they measured by the measure of an omer He who collected more did not have too much; nor did he who prepared less find too little But each one gathered according to what they were able to eatAnd Moses said to them Let no one leave any of it behind until morningAnd they did not listen to him but they left some of it behind until morning and it began to swarm with worms and it putrefied And Moses became angry against themThen each one collected in the morning as much as would be sufficient to eat And after the sun became hot it meltedBut on the sixth day they collected a double portion that is two omers for each man Then all the leaders among the multitude came and they discoursed with MosesAnd he said to them This is what the Lord has spoken Tomorrow the rest day of the Sabbath has been sanctified to the Lord Whatever would be done do it now And whatever would be cooked cook it now Then anything that will have been left over store it until morningAnd they did just as Moses had instructed and it did not putrefy nor were there any worms found in itAnd Moses said Eat it today because it is the Sabbath of the Lord Today it will not be found in the fieldGather for six days But on the seventh day it is the Sabbath of the Lord for which reason it will not be foundAnd the seventh day arrived And some of the people going out to collect it did not find itThen the Lord said to Moses How long will you be unwilling to keep my commandments and my lawSee how the Lord has given you the Sabbath and because of this on the sixth day he distributes to you a double portion Let each one remain with his own and let no one go forth from his place on the seventh dayAnd the people kept the Sabbath on the seventh dayAnd the house of Israel called its name Manna It was like white coriander seed and its taste was like wheat flour with honeyThen Moses said This is the word that the Lord has instructed Fill an omer of it and let it be kept for future generations hereafter so that they may know the bread with which I nourished you in the wilderness when you had been led away from the land of EgyptAnd Moses said to Aaron Take one vessel and put manna into it as much as an omer is able to hold And store it in the sight of the Lord to keep for your generationsjust as the Lord instructed Moses And so Aaron placed it in the tabernacle in reserveNow the sons of Israel ate manna for forty years until they arrived in a habitable land With this food they were nourished even until they touched the borders of the land of CanaanNow an omer is a tenth part of an ephahAnd so the entire multitude of the sons of Israel having set out from the desert of Sin in stages according to the word of the Lord made camp at Rephidim where there was no water for the people to drinkAnd arguing against Moses they said Give us water so that we may drink And Moses answered them Why argue against me For what reason do you tempt the LordAnd so the people were thirsty in that place due to the scarcity of water and they murmured against Moses saying Why did you cause us to go out of Egypt so as to kill us and our children as well as our cattle with thirstThen Moses cried out to the Lord saying What shall I do with this people A little while more and they will stone meAnd the Lord said to Moses Go before the people and take with you some of the elders of Israel And take in your hand the staff with which you struck the river and advanceLo I will stand in that place before you on the rock of Horeb And you shall strike the rock and water will go forth from it so that the people may drink Moses did so in the sight of the elders of IsraelAnd he called the name of that place Temptation because of the arguing of the sons of Israel and because they tempted the Lord saying Is the Lord with us or notAnd Amalek came and fought against Israel at RephidimAnd Moses said to Joshua Choose men And when you go out fight against Amalek Tomorrow I will stand at the top of the hill holding the staff of God in my handJoshua did as Moses had spoken and he fought against Amalek But Moses and Aaron and Hur ascended to the top of the hillAnd when Moses lifted up his hands Israel prevailed But when he released them a little while Amalek overcameThen the hands of Moses became heavy And so taking a stone they placed it beneath him and he sat on it Then Aaron and Hur sustained his hands from both sides And it happened that his hands did not tire until the setting of the sunAnd Joshua put to flight Amalek and his people by the edge of the swordThen the Lord said to Moses Write this as a memorial in a book and deliver it to the ears of Joshua For I will wipe away the memory of Amalek from under heavenAnd Moses built an altar And he called its name The Lord my Exaltation For he saidThe hand of the throne of the Lord and the war of the Lord will be against Amalek from generation to generationAnd when Jethro the priest of Midian the kinsman of Moses had heard all that God had done for Moses and for his people Israel and that the Lord had led Israel away from Egypthe brought Zipporah the wife of Moses whom he was to return to himand her two sons of whom one was called Gershom (for his father said I have been a newcomer in a foreign land)and the other in truth was Eliezer (For the God of my father he said is my helper and has rescued me from the sword of Pharaoh)And so Jethro the kinsman of Moses with his sons and his wife came to Moses in the desert where he was encamped next to the mountain of GodAnd he sent word to Moses saying I Jethro your kinsman have come to you with your wife and your two sons with herAnd going out to meet his kinsman he reverenced and kissed him And they saluted each other with peaceful words And when he had arrived at the tentMoses explained to his kinsman all that the Lord had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians on behalf of Israel and all the hardships which had befallen them on the journey and how the Lord had freed themAnd Jethro was gladdened over all the good that the Lord had done for Israel because he had rescued them from the hand of the EgyptiansAnd he said Blessed is the Lord who has freed his people from the hand of the Egyptians and from the hand of Pharaoh; he has rescued his people from the hand of EgyptNow I know that the great Lord is above all gods This is why they acted arrogantly against themAnd so Jethro the kinsman of Moses offered holocausts and sacrifices to God And Aaron arrived with all the elders of Israel in order to eat bread with him in the sight of GodThen the next day Moses sat down in order to judge the people and they stood beside Moses from morning even until eveningAnd when of course his kinsman saw all that he did among the people he said What is this that you do among the people Why do you sit alone while all the people stand before you from morning even until eveningAnd Moses answered him The people come to me seeking the verdict of GodAnd when any kind of dispute occurs among them they come to me to judge between them and to reveal the precepts of God and of his lawsBut he said This is not good what you are doingYou will be consumed by foolish efforts both you and this people who are with you The task is beyond your strength; you will not be able bear it aloneBut listen to my words and counsels and then God will be with you Be available to the people in that which pertains to God so as to refer what they say to himand to reveal to the people the ceremonies and the rituals of worship and the way by which they should progress and the work that they should doThen provide from all of the people men capable and fearing God in whom there is truth and who hate avarice and appoint from them tribunes and leaders of hundreds and of fifties and of tenswho may judge the people at all times Then when anything greater will have occurred they may refer it to you and let them judge the lesser matters only And so it may be lighter for you the burden being divided among othersIf you will do this you will fulfill the orders of God and you will be able to uphold his precepts And this entire people will return to their places in peaceHaving heard this Moses did everything that he had suggested to himAnd choosing virtuous men from all of Israel he appointed them as leaders of the people tribunes and leaders of hundreds and of fifties and of tensAnd they judged the people at all times But whatever was more serious they referred to him and they judged easier matters onlyAnd he dismissed his kinsman who turning back went to his own landIn the third month of the departure of Israel from the land of Egypt in that day they arrived in the wilderness of SinaiThus setting out from Raphidim and going directly to the desert of Sinai they encamped in the same place and there Israel pitched their tents away from the region of the mountainThen Moses ascended to God And the Lord called to him from the mountain and he said This you shall say to the house of Jacob and announce to the sons of IsraelYou have seen what I have done to the Egyptians in what way I carried you upon the wings of eagles and how I have taken you for myselfIf therefore you will hear my voice and you will keep my covenant you will be to me a particular possession out of all people For all the earth is mineAnd you will be to me a priestly kingdom and a holy nation These are the words that you will speak to the sons of IsraelMoses went and calling together those greater by birth among the people he set forth all the words which the Lord had commandedAnd all the people responded together Everything that the Lord has spoken we shall do And when Moses had related the words of the people to the Lordthe Lord said to him Soon now I will come to you in the mist of a cloud so that the people may hear me speaking to you and so that they may believe you continuously Therefore Moses reported the words of the people to the Lordwho said to him Go to the people and sanctify them today and tomorrow and let them wash their garmentsAnd let them be prepared on the third day For on the third day the Lord will descend in the sight of all the people over Mount SinaiAnd you will establish limits for the people all around and you will say to them Take care not to ascend to the mountain and that you do not touch its parts All who touch the mountain shall die a deathHands shall not touch him but he shall be crushed with stones or he shall be pierced through with darts Whether it be a beast or a man he shall not live For when the trumpet begins to sound perhaps they might go up toward the mountainAnd Moses came down from the mountain to the people and he sanctified them And when they had washed their garmentshe said to them Be prepared on the third day and do not draw near to your wivesAnd now the third day arrived and the morning dawned And behold thunders began to be heard and also lightning flashed and a very dense cloud covered the mountain and the noise of the trumpet resounded vehemently And the people who were in the camp were fearfulAnd when Moses had led them out to meet God from the place of the camp they stood at the base of the mountainThen all of Mount Sinai was smoking For the Lord had descended over it with fire and smoke ascended from it as from a furnace And the entire mountain was terribleAnd the sound of the trumpet gradually increased to be louder and extended to be longer Moses was speaking and God was answering himAnd the Lord descended over Mount Sinai to the very top of the mountain and he called Moses to its summit And when he had ascended therehe said to him Descend and call the people to witness lest they might be willing to transgress the limits so as to see the Lord and a very great multitude of them might perishLikewise the priests who approach toward the Lord let them be sanctified lest he strike them downAnd Moses said to the Lord The people are not able to ascend to Mount Sinai For you testified and you commanded saying Set limits around the mountain and sanctify it And the Lord said to him Go descend And you shall ascend and Aaron with you But let not the priests or the people transgress the limits nor ascend to the Lord lest perhaps he may put them to deathAnd Moses descended to the people and he explained everything to themAnd the Lord spoke all these wordsI am the Lord your God who led you away from the land of Egypt out of the house of servitudeYou shall not have strange gods before meYou shall not make for yourself a graven image nor a likeness of anything that is in heaven above or on earth below nor of those things which are in the waters under the earthYou shall not adore them nor shall you worship them I am the Lord your God strong zealous visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the sons to the third and fourth generation of those who hate meand showing mercy to thousands of those who love me and keep my preceptsYou shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain For the Lord will not hold harmless one who takes the name of the Lord his God falselyRemember that you are to sanctify the day of the SabbathFor six days you will work and accomplish all your tasksBut the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord your God You shall not do any work in it you and your son and your daughter your male servant and your female servant your beast and the newcomer who is within your gatesFor in six days the Lord made heaven and earth and the sea and all the things that are in them and so he rested on the seventh day For this reason the Lord has blessed the day of the Sabbath and sanctified itHonor your father and your mother so that you may have a long life upon the land which the Lord your God will give to youYou shall not murderYou shall not commit adulteryYou shall not stealYou shall not speak false testimony against your neighborYou shall not covet the house of your neighbor; neither shall you desire his wife nor male servant nor female servant nor ox nor donkey nor anything that is hisThen all the people considered the voices and the lights and the sound of the trumpet and the smoking mountain And being terrified and struck with fear they stood at a distancesaying to Moses Speak to us and we will listen Let not the Lord speak to us lest perhaps we may dieAnd Moses said to the people Do not be afraid For God came in order to test you and so that the dread of him might be with you and you would not sinAnd the people stood far away But Moses approached toward the mist in which was GodThereafter the Lord said to Moses This you shall say to the sons of Israel You have seen that I have spoken to you from heavenYou shall not make gods of silver nor shall you make for yourselves gods of goldYou shall make an altar from the earth for me and you shall offer upon it your holocausts and peace-offerings your sheep and oxen in every place where the memory of my name shall be I will come to you and I will bless youAnd if you make an altar of stone for me you shall not build it from cut stones; for if you lift up a tool over it it will be defiledYou shall not ascend by steps to my altar lest your nakedness be revealedThese are the judgments which you shall place before themIf you buy a Hebrew servant six years shall he serve you; in the seventh he shall depart freely without chargeWith whatever clothing he arrived with the like let him depart If he has a wife his wife also shall depart at the same timeBut if his lord gave him a wife and she has borne sons and daughters the woman and her children shall belong to her lord Yet still he himself will go out with his clothingAnd if the servant will say I love my lord and my wife and children I will not depart freelythen his lord shall make an offering for him to the heavens and it shall be applied to the door and the posts and he will pierce his ear with an awl And he shall be his servant in perpetuityIf anyone sells his daughter to be a servant she shall not depart as a female servant is accustomed to go outIf she displeases the eyes of her lord to whom she had been delivered he shall dismiss her But he shall have no authority to sell her to a foreign people even if he despises herBut if he has betrothed her to his son he shall treat her according to the custom with daughtersAnd if he takes another for him he shall provide to the maiden a marriage and clothing and he shall not refuse the price of her chastityIf he does not do these three things she shall depart freely without moneyWhoever strikes a man intending to murder shall be put to deathBut if he did not lie in wait for him but God delivered him into his hands then I will appoint for you a place to which he must fleeIf someone murders his neighbor with deliberation by lying in wait you shall tear him away from my altar so that he may dieWhoever strikes his father or mother shall die a deathWhoever will have stolen a man and sold him having been convicted of the crime shall be put to deathWhoever speaks evil of his father or mother shall die a deathIf men will have quarreled and one of them has struck his neighbor with a stone or a fist and he does not die but lies in bedif he gets up again and can walk outside on his staff he who struck him will be innocent but only if he makes sufficient restitution for his deeds and for the cost of the physiciansWhoever strikes his male or female servant with a staff and if they have died by his hands he shall be guilty of a crimeBut if he survives for one day or two he shall not be subject to punishment because it is his moneyIf men will have quarreled and one of them has struck a pregnant woman and as a result she miscarries but she herself survives he shall be subject to as much damage as the husband of the woman shall petition from him or as arbitrators shall judgeBut if her death will have followed he will repay a life for a lifean eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth a hand for a hand a foot for a foota scrape for a scrape a wound for a wound a bruise for a bruiseIf anyone will have struck the eye of his male or female servant having left them with one eye he shall release them freely because of the eye that he has put outLikewise if he knocks out a tooth of his male or female servant he shall similarly release them freelyIf an ox has struck a man or a woman with his horn and if they die it shall be stoned And its flesh shall not be eaten; also the owner of the ox will be innocentBut if the ox had been pushing with his horn from yesterday and the day before and they warned his owner but he did not confine it and it will have killed a man or a woman then the ox shall be stoned and his owner shall be killedBut if they have imposed a price on him he shall give in exchange for his life whatever is askedLikewise if it has struck a son or a daughter with its horns it shall be subject to a similar verdictIf it attacks a male or female servant he shall give thirty shekels of silver to their lord yet truly the ox shall be stonedIf a man digs or opens a cistern and does not cover it and an ox or a donkey falls into itthen the owner of the cistern shall repay the price of the beasts and what is dead will belong to himIf the ox of a stranger wounds the ox of another and it has died then they shall sell the live ox and divide the price but the carcass of the dead one they shall distribute between themBut if he knew that his ox had pushed with its horns yesterday and the day before and its owner did not confine it then he shall repay an ox for an ox and he will receive the whole carcassIf anyone will have stolen an ox or a sheep and if he kills it or sells it then he will restore five oxen for one ox and four sheep for one sheepIf a thief will have been discovered breaking into a house or digging under it and he has received a mortal wound he who struck him down will not be guilty of bloodBut if he did this when the sun was risen he has perpetrated a homicide and he shall die If he does not have the means to make restitution for the theft he shall be soldIf whatever he stole should be found with him a living thing either an ox or a donkey or a sheep he shall repay doubleIf there is any damage to a field or a vineyard when he has released his cattle to pasture on the land of a stranger he shall repay the best of what he has in his own field or in his own vineyard according to the estimation of the damageIf a fire will have been discovered departing from brush and taking hold in stacks of grain or in crops standing in the fields whoever ignited the fire shall repay the damagesIf anyone will have entrusted money or a container to his friend to keep and if these have been stolen from the one who received them if the thief is found he shall repay doubleIf the thief is unknown the lord of the house will be brought before the heavens to swear that he did not lay his hand on the goods of his neighborso as to perpetrate any fraud such as with an ox or a donkey or a sheep or clothing nor to do anything that would be able to cause damage The case of both shall be brought before the heavens And if they give judgment against him he shall repay double to his neighborIf anyone will have entrusted a donkey an ox a sheep or any animal to the keeping of his neighbor and it will have died or become disabled or have been captured by enemies and no one saw itthen there shall be an oath between them that he did not lay his hand on the goods of his neighbor And the owner shall accept the oath and he will not be compelled to make restitutionBut if it will have been taken away by theft he shall repay the damages to the ownerIf it has been eaten by a wild beast let him carry what was killed to him and then he shall not make restitutionIf anyone borrows from his neighbor any of these things and it has died or been disabled when the owner was not present he shall be compelled to make restitutionBut if the owner was present he shall not make restitution especially if it had been brought for hired workIf a man has led astray a virgin not yet betrothed and he has slept with her he shall pay her dowry and have her as a wifeIf the father of the virgin is not willing to give her he shall pay money according to manner of a dowry which virgins are accustomed to receiveYou shall not permit practitioners of the black arts to liveWhoever has sexual intercourse with an animal shall be put to deathWhoever immolates to gods other than to the Lord shall be killedYou shall not harass the newcomer nor shall you afflict him For you yourselves were once newcomers in the land of EgyptYou shall not harm a widow or an orphanIf you hurt them they will cry out to me and I will hear their cryAnd my fury will be enraged and I will strike you down with the sword And your wives will become widows and your sons will become orphansIf you lend money to the poor of my people who live among you you shall not coerce them like a collector nor oppress them with usuryIf you take a garment from your neighbor as a pledge you shall return it to him again before the setting of the sunFor it is all that he has to cover himself to clothe his body; nor does he have anything else in which to sleep If he cries out to me I will hear him because I am compassionateYou shall not disparage the heavens and you shall not speak evil of the leader of your peopleYou shall not delay in paying your tithes and your first-fruits You shall give the firstborn of your sons to meYou shall do likewise with those of the oxen and the sheep For seven days let it be with its mother; on the eighth day you shall repay it to meYou shall be holy men for me The flesh from which beasts will have tasted you shall not eat but you will throw it to the dogsYou shall not accept a lying voice Neither shall you join your hand so as to give false testimony on behalf of the impiousYou shall not follow the crowd in doing evil Neither shall you go astray in judgment by agreeing with the majority opinion apart from the truthLikewise you shall not show pity in judgment of the poorIf you come across an ox or a donkey of your enemy which has gone astray lead it back to himIf you see the donkey of one who hates you fallen under its burden you shall not pass by without lifting it up with himYou shall not deviate in judgment of the poorYou shall flee from lies The innocent and the just you shall not kill For I shun the impiousNeither shall you accept bribes which blind even the prudent and subvert the words of the justYou shall not harass a sojourner for you know the life of a newcomer For you yourselves also were sojourners in the land of EgyptFor six years you shall sow your land and gather its produceBut in the seventh year you shall release it and cause it to rest so that the poor of your people may eat And whatever remains let the beasts of the field eat it So shall you do with your vineyard and your olive groveFor six days you shall work On the seventh day you shall cease so that your ox and your donkey may rest and so that the newcomer and the son of your handmaid may be refreshedPreserve all that I have said to you And by the names of foreign gods you shall not swear; neither shall these be heard from your mouthThree times in each year you shall celebrate feasts to meYou shall keep the solemnity of unleavened bread For seven days you shall eat unleavened bread just as I instructed you at the time of the month of new grain when you departed from Egypt You shall not appear empty-handed in my sightfor it is the solemnity of the harvest of the first-fruits of your work of whatever you have sown in the field Likewise it is a solemnity at the end of the season when you will have gathered in all your crops from the fieldThree times a year all your males shall appear before the Lord your GodYou shall not immolate the blood of my victim over leaven nor shall the fat of my solemnity remain until morningYou shall carry the first grain of the land to the house of the Lord your God You shall not cook a young goat in the milk of its motherBehold I will send my Angel who will go before you and preserve you on your journey and lead you into the place that I have preparedHeed him and hear his voice and do not hold him in disregard For he will not release you when you have sinned and my name is in himBut if you listen to his voice and do all that I say I will be an enemy to your enemies and I will afflict those who afflict youAnd my Angel will go before you and he will bring you to the Amorite and the Hittite and the Perizzite and the Canaanite and the Hivite and the Jebusite whom I will crushYou shall not adore their gods nor worship them You shall not do their works but you shall destroy them and break apart their statuesAnd you shall serve the Lord your God so that I may bless your bread and your waters and so that I may take away sickness from your midstThere will not be fruitless or barren ones in your land I will fill up the number of your daysI will send my terror to run ahead of you and I will kill all the people to whom you will enter And I will turn the backs of all your enemies before yousending wasps ahead so that they will put to flight the Hivite and the Canaanite and the Hittite before you enterI will not cast them out from your face in one year lest the land be reduced to a wilderness and the wild beasts increase against youI will expel them little by little from your sight until you have expanded and may possess the landThen I will set your limits to be from the Red Sea to the Sea of the Palestinians and from the desert all the way to the river I will deliver into your hands the inhabitants of the land and I will cast them out from your sightYou shall not enter into a pact with them nor with their godsThey may not live on your land lest perhaps they may cause you to sin against me if you serve their gods which certainly would be a temptation for youHe also said to Moses Ascend to the Lord you and Aaron Nadab and Abihu and seventy elders out of Israel and adore from a distanceAnd only Moses will ascend to the Lord and these shall not approach Neither shall the people ascend with himTherefore Moses went and explained to the people all the words of the Lord as well as the judgments And all the people responded with one voice We will do all the words of the Lord which he has spokenThen Moses wrote all the words of the Lord And rising up in the morning he built an altar at the base of the mountain with twelve titles according to the twelve tribes of IsraelAnd he sent youths from the sons of Israel and they offered holocausts and they immolated calves as peace-offerings to the LordAnd so Moses took one half part of the blood and he put it into bowls Then the remaining part he poured over the altarAnd taking up the book of the covenant he read it in the hearing of the people who said All that the Lord has spoken we will do and we will be obedientIn truth taking up the blood he sprinkled it on the people and he said This is the blood of the covenant which the Lord has formed with you concerning all these wordsAnd Moses and Aaron Nadab and Abihu and seventy of the elders of Israel ascendedAnd they saw the God of Israel And under his feet was something like a work of sapphire stone or like the sky when it is sereneNeither did he lay his hand upon those of the sons of Israel who were at a distance And they saw God and they ate and drankThen the Lord said to Moses Ascend to me on the mountain and be there And I will give to you tablets of stone and the law and the commandments that I have written So may you teach themMoses rose up with Joshua his minister And Moses ascending on the mountain of Godsaid to the elders Wait here until we return to you You have Aaron and Hur with you If any question arises you shall refer it to themAnd when Moses had ascended a cloud covered the mountainAnd the glory of the Lord dwelt upon Sinai covering it with a cloud for six days And on the seventh day he called to him from the middle of the mistNow the appearance of the glory of the Lord was like a burning fire over the summit of the mountain in the sight of the sons of IsraelAnd Moses entering into the midst of the cloud ascended the mountain And he was there for forty days and forty nightsAnd the Lord spoke to Moses sayingSpeak to the sons of Israel so that they may take the first-fruits to me You shall accept these from every man who offers of his own accordNow these are the things that you must accept Gold and silver and brasshyacinth and purple and twice-dyed scarlet and fine linen the hair of goatsand the skins of rams dyed red and skins of violet and setim woodoil to prepare lights aromatics as ointments and sweet-smelling incenseonyx stones and gems to adorn the ephod as well as the breastplateAnd they shall make a sanctuary for me and I will live in their midstAccording to exact likeness of the tabernacle and all of the vessels for its rituals that I will reveal to you so shall you make itJoin together an ark of setim wood whose length shall hold two and one half cubits; the width one and one half cubits; the height likewise one and one half cubitsAnd you shall overlay it with the finest gold inside and out And over it you shall fashion a gold crown all aroundand four gold rings which you shall set into the four corners of the ark Let two rings be on one side and two on the otherLikewise you shall make bars of setim wood and cover them with goldAnd you shall put them through the rings that are in the sides of the ark so that it may be carried on themThese must always be in the rings neither shall they ever be drawn out of themAnd you shall place the testimony which I will give to you in the arkYou shall also make a propitiatory of the finest gold Its length shall hold two and one half cubits and the width one and one half cubitsLikewise you shall make two Cherubim of formed gold on both sides of the oracleLet one Cherub be on the one side and the other be on the otherAnd let them cover both sides of the propitiatory spreading their wings and covering the oracle and let them look out toward one another their faces being turned toward the propitiatory with which the ark is to be coveredin which you will place the testimony that I will give to youFrom there I will warn you and speak to you above the propitiatory and from the middle of the two Cherubim which will be over the ark of the testimony about everything that I will command of the sons of Israel through youYou shall also make a table of setim wood having two cubits of length and one cubit in width and one cubit and one half cubits in heightAnd you shall overlay it with the purest gold And you shall make it with a gold lip all aroundand for the lip itself an engraved crown four fingers high and above it another little gold crownLikewise you shall prepare four gold rings and set them in the four corners of the same table over each footUnder the crown there shall be gold rings so that the bars may be put through them and the table may be carriedLikewise the bars themselves you shall make of setim wood and surround them with gold to lift up the tableYou shall also prepare small cups as well as bowls censers and measuring cups with which the libations shall be offered out of the purest goldAnd you shall place upon the table the bread of the presence in my sight alwaysYou shall also make a lampstand formed from the finest gold along with its stem and arms its bowl and little spheres as well as the lilies proceeding from itSix branches shall go out from the sides three out of one side and three out of the otherThree bowls the size of nuts shall be on each branch and a little sphere with it and a lily And three similar bowls in the likeness of nuts shall be on the other branch and a little sphere with it and a lily This shall be the form of the six branches which are to proceed from the stemThen in the lampstand itself there shall be four bowls the size of nuts and each with little spheres and liliesLittle spheres under two branches in three places which together make six shall proceed from one of the stemsThus both the little spheres and the branches shall be made out of the same thing entirely formed from the purest goldYou shall also make seven lamps and you shall place them upon the lampstand so that they may give light in every directionLikewise the candle snuffers and the place where the candles will be extinguished shall be made from the purest goldThe entire weight of the candlestick with all its parts shall hold one talent of the purest goldObserve and then make it according to the example that was shown to you on the mountainTruly thus shall you make the tabernacle You shall make ten curtains of fine twisted linen and hyacinth as well as purple and twice-dyed scarlet with diverse embroideryThe length of one curtain shall have twenty-eight cubits The width shall be four cubits The entire set of curtains shall be of one measureFive curtains shall be joined to one another and the other five shall be similarly coupled togetherYou shall make loops of hyacinth on the sides at the edges of the curtains so that they will be able to be joined to one anotherA curtain shall have fifty loops on each of two sides inserted in such a manner that loop may come against loop

me in the priesthood Take a calf from the herd and two immaculate ramsand unleavened bread and a crust without leaven that has been sprinkled with oil likewise unleavened cakes smeared with oil You

and the dung you shall burn outside beyond the camp because it is for sinLikewise you shall take one ram and upon its head Aaron and his sons shall lay their handsAnd when you will have sacrificed it you shall take from its blood and pour it around the altarThen you shall cut the ram into pieces and having washed its intestines and feet you shall place these upon the cut-up flesh and upon its headAnd you shall offer the entire ram as a burnt offering upon the altar It is an oblation to the Lord a most sweet odor of the victim of the LordLikewise you shall take the other ram upon whose head Aaron and his sons shall lay their handsAnd when you will have immolated it you shall take of its blood and place it on the tip of the right ear of Aaron and his sons and on the thumbs and big toes of their right hand and right foot and you shall pour the blood upon the altar all aroundAnd when you have taken from the blood that is on the altar and from the oil of unction you shall sprinkle Aaron and his vestment his sons and their vestments And after they and their vestments have been consecratedyou shall take the fat of the ram and the rump and the lard that covers the internal organs and the mesh of the liver and the two kidneys along with the fat that is on them and the right shoulder because it is the ram of consecrationand one turn of bread a crust sprinkled with oil and a cake from the basket of unleavened bread which was placed in the sight of the LordAnd you shall place all these in the hands of Aaron and his sons and you shall sanctify them lifting them up in the sight of the LordAnd you shall take all these things from their hands and burn them upon the altar as a holocaust as a most sweet odor in the sight of the Lord because it is his oblationLikewise you shall take the chest of the ram with which Aaron was initiated and you shall sanctify it lifting it up in the sight of the Lord and it will fall to your shareAnd you shall sanctify both the consecrated chest and the shoulder that you separated from the ramwith which Aaron was initiated with his sons and these will fall to the share of Aaron and his sons as a perpetual oath by the sons of Israel For these are the greatest and the first of their victims of peace which they offer to the LordBut the holy vestment which Aaron shall use his sons shall possess after him so that they may be anointed in it and their hands may be consecratedFor seven days he who is high priest in his place and who enters the tabernacle of the testimony to minister in the Sanctuary shall use itBut you shall take the ram of consecration and cook its flesh in the holy placeAnd Aaron and his sons shall feed on it Likewise the loaves which are in the basket they shall consume in the vestibule of the tabernacle of the testimonyso that it may be an appeasing sacrifice and so that the hands of those who offer may be sanctified A stranger shall not eat from these for they are holyAnd what may remain until morning of the consecrated flesh or of the bread you shall burn these remnants with fire These shall not be eaten because they have been sanctifiedAll that I have instructed you concerning Aaron and his sons you shall do For seven days shall you consecrate their handsand you shall offer a calf for sin on each day as an atonement And you shall cleanse the altar when you will have immolated the victim of expiation and you shall anoint it for sanctificationFor seven days you shall expiate and sanctify the altar and it shall be the Holy of holies All those who will touch it must be sanctifiedThis is what you shall acquire for the altar Two one-year-old lambs each day continuallyone lamb in the morning and the other in the evening;for the one lamb a tenth part of fine flour sprinkled with crushed oil which shall have the measure of the fourth part of a hin and wine for a libation of the same measure;truly the other lamb you shall offer in the evening according to the ritual of the morning oblation and according to what we have said as an odor of sweetnessIt is a sacrifice to the Lord by a perpetual oblation among your generations at the door of the tabernacle of the testimony before the Lord where I resolve to speak to youAnd there I will instruct the sons of Israel and the altar shall be sanctified by my gloryI will also sanctify the tabernacle of the testimony with the altar and Aaron with his sons to exercise the priesthood for meAnd I will live in the midst of the sons of Israel and I will be their GodAnd they shall know that I am the Lord their God who led them away from the land of Egypt so that I might dwell among them I am the Lord their GodYou shall also make an altar for the burning of incense from setim woodhaving one cubit in length and another in width that is four equal sides and two cubits in height Horns shall proceed from the sameAnd you shall clothe it with the purest gold both its grating and the walls around it and also the horns And you shall make for it a crown of gold in a circleand two gold rings under the crown on each side so that the bars may be set in them and the altar may be carriedAlso you shall make its bars of setim wood and you shall overlay them with goldAnd you shall set the altar opposite the veil which hangs in front of the ark of the testimony before the propitiatory with which the testimony is covered where I will speak to youAnd Aaron shall burn incense upon it a sweet fragrance in the morning When he lights the lamps he shall burn itAnd when he assembles them in the evening he shall burn an everlasting incense before the Lord throughout your generationsYou shall not offer upon it incense of another composition nor an oblation nor a victim; neither shall you offer libationsAnd Aaron shall pray over its horns once a year with the blood of what was offered for sin And he shall make atonement over it in your generations It shall be the Holy of holies to the LordAnd the Lord spoke to Moses sayingWhen you have taken the sum of the sons of Israel according to their number each shall give a price for their souls to the Lord and there will be no scourge among them when they will be reviewedThen all those who pass shall give by name one half shekel according to the measure at the temple A shekel has twenty obols The half part of a shekel shall be offered to the LordHe who has been numbered from twenty years and above shall give the priceThe rich shall not add to the half shekel and the poor shall diminish nothingAnd the money received which was collected from the sons of Israel you shall deliver for the uses of the tabernacle of the testimony so that it may be a memorial of them before the Lord and he may act favorably toward their soulsAnd the Lord spoke to Moses sayingYou shall also make a bronze washtub with its base to wash in; and you shall place it between the tabernacle of the testimony and the altar And when water has been addedAaron and his sons shall wash their hands and feet in itwhen they enter the tabernacle of the testimony and when they approach to the altar so as to offer incense to the Lord upon itotherwise they may die This shall be an everlasting law to him and to his offspring throughout their successionsAnd the Lord spoke to Mosessaying Take for yourself aromatics of the first and best myrrh five hundred shekels and of cinnamon half as much that is two hundred and fifty shekels; of sweet flag similarly two hundred and fiftybut of cassia five hundred shekels by the weight of the sanctuary and of the oil of olives the measure of a hinAnd you shall make the holy oil of unction an ointment composed with the skills of a perfumerand with it you shall anoint the tabernacle of the testimony and the ark of the testamentand the table with its vessels and the lampstand and its utensils the altars of incenseand of holocaust and all the items that pertain to their ritualsAnd you shall sanctify everything and they shall be the Holy of holies He who will touch them must be sanctifiedYou shall anoint Aaron and his sons and you shall sanctify them so that they may exercise the priesthood for meLikewise you shall say to the sons of Israel This oil of unction will be holy to me throughout your generationsThe flesh of man shall not be anointed from it and you shall not make any similar compound for it has been sanctified and it shall be holy to youWhatever man will have composed such a thing and have given it to a stranger he shall be exterminated from his people And the Lord said to Moses Take to yourself aromatics stacte and onycha galbanum of sweet odor and the clearest frankincense all these shall be of equal weightAnd you shall make incense composed with the skills of a perfumer diligently mixed and pure and most worthy of sanctificationAnd when you have crushed all these into a very fine powder you shall place some of it before the tabernacle of the testimony in the place where I will appear to you The Holy of holies shall this incense be to youYou shall not make such a compound for your own uses because it is holy to the LordWhatever man will have made anything similar so as to thoroughly enjoy its smell he shall perish from his peopleAnd the Lord spoke to Moses sayingBehold I have called by name Bezalel the son of Uri the son of Hur from the tribe of Judahand I have filled him with the Spirit of God with wisdom and understanding and knowledge in every craftin order to design whatever must be fabricated from gold and silver and brassfrom marble and precious stones and various woodsAnd I have given to him as his associate Oholiab the son of Ahisamach from the tribe of Dan And I have placed wisdom in the heart of every artisan so that they may make everything as I have instructed youthe tabernacle of the covenant and the ark of the testimony and the propitiatory which is over it and all the vessels of the tabernacleand the table and its vessels the most pure lampstand with its vessels and the altars of incenseand of holocaust and all their vessels the washtub with its basethe holy vestments for the ministry of Aaron the priest and for his sons so that they may execute their office of sacred ritesthe oil of unction and the incense of aromatics in the Sanctuary All the things that I have instructed you they shall makeAnd the Lord spoke to Moses sayingSpeak to the sons of Israel and you shall say to them See that you keep my Sabbath For it is a sign between me and you among your generations so that you may know that I am the Lord who sanctifies youKeep my Sabbath for it is holy to you Whoever will have polluted it shall die a death Whoever will have done any work in it his soul shall perish from the midst of his peopleFor six days you shall do work On the seventh day it is the Sabbath a rest sanctified by the Lord All who will have done work on this day shall dieLet the sons of Israel keep the Sabbath and let them celebrate it throughout their generations It is an everlasting covenantbetween me and the sons of Israel and a perpetual sign For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth and in the seventh he ceased from workAnd the Lord having completed speaking in this way on Mount Sinai gave to Moses two stone tablets of testimony written with the finger of GodThen the people seeing that Moses made a delay in descending from the mountain gathered together against Aaron and said Rise up make us gods who may go before us But as for this man Moses who led us away from the land of Egypt we do not know what has befallen himAnd Aaron said to them Take the golden earrings from the ears of your wives and your sons and daughters and bring them to meAnd the people did what he had commanded carrying the earrings to AaronAnd when he had received them he formed these by the work of a casting furnace and he made from these a molten calf And they said These are your gods O Israel who led you away from the land of EgyptAnd when Aaron had seen it he built an altar before it and he cried out with a voice of proclamation saying Tomorrow is the solemnity of the LordAnd rising up in the morning they offered holocausts and peace victims and the people sat down to eat and to drink and they rose up to playThen the Lord spoke to Moses saying Go descend Your people whom you led away from the land of Egypt have sinnedThey have quickly withdrawn from the way which you revealed to them And they have made for themselves a molten calf and they have worshiped it And immolating victims to it they have said These are your gods O Israel who led you away from the land of Egypt And again the Lord said to Moses I discern that this people is stiff-neckedRelease me so that my fury may be enraged against them and I may destroy them and then I will make of you a great nationThen Moses prayed to the Lord his God saying Why O Lord is your fury enraged against your people whom you led away from the land of Egypt with great strength and with a mighty handI beg you let not the Egyptians say He cleverly led them away so that he could put them to death in the mountains and destroy them from the earth Let your anger be quieted and appeased concerning the wickedness of your peopleRemember Abraham Isaac and Israel your servants to whom you swore by your very self saying I will multiply your offspring like the stars of heaven And this entire land about which I have spoken I will give to your offspring And you shall possess it forever And the Lord was appeased from doing the evil which he had spoken against his peopleAnd Moses returned from the mountain carrying the two tablets of the testimony in his hand written on both sidesand accomplished by the work of God Also the writing of God was engraved on the tabletsThen Joshua hearing the tumult of the people shouting said to Moses The outcry of battle is heard in the campBut he responded It is not the clamor of men being exhorted to battle nor the shout of men being compelled to flee But I hear the voice of singingAnd when he had approached to the camp he saw the calf and the dances And being very angry he threw down the tablets from his hand and he broke them at the base of the mountainAnd seizing the calf which they had made he burnt it and crushed it even to dust which he scattered into water And he gave from it to the sons of Israel to drinkAnd he said to Aaron What has this people done to you so that you would bring upon them the greatest sinAnd he answered him Let not my lord be indignant For you know this people that they are prone to evilThey said to me Make gods for us who may go before us For this Moses who led us away from the land of Egypt we do not know what has befallen himAnd I said to them Which of you has gold And they took it and gave it to me And I threw it into the fire and this calf came outTherefore Moses seeing that the people were naked (for Aaron had stripped them because of the disgrace of their sordidness and he had set them naked among their enemies)and standing at the gate of the camp said If anyone is for the Lord let him join with me And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together to himAnd he said to them Thus says the Lord God of Israel Let a man place his sword at his thigh Go forth and then return from gate to gate through the midst of the camp and let each one kill his brother and friend and neighborAnd the sons of Levi did according to the words of Moses and there fell on that day about twenty-three thousand menAnd Moses said On this day you have consecrated your hands to the Lord each one in his son and in his brother so that a blessing may be given to youThen when the next day arrived Moses spoke to the people You have sinned the greatest sin I will ascend to the Lord Perhaps in some way I might be able to entreat him for your wickednessAnd returning to the Lord he said I beg you this people has sinned the greatest sin and they have made for themselves gods of gold Either release them from this offenseor if you do not then delete me from the book that you have writtenAnd the Lord answered him Whoever has sinned against me him I will delete from my bookBut as for you go and lead this people where I have told you My angel will go before you Then on the day of retribution I will also visit this sin of theirsTherefore the Lord struck the people for the guilt of the calf which Aaron had madeAnd the Lord spoke to Moses saying Go forth ascend from this place you and your people whom you led away from the land of Egypt into the land that I swore to Abraham Isaac and Jacob saying To your offspring I will give itAnd I will send an Angel to precede you so that I may cast out the Canaanite and the Amorite and the Hittite and the Perizzite and the Hivite and the Jebusiteand so that you may enter into a land flowing with milk and honey For I will not go up with you since you are a stiff-necked people lest perhaps I may destroy you on the wayAnd upon hearing this very bad news the people mourned; and no one put on his finery according to customAnd the Lord said to Moses Say to the sons of Israel You are a stiff-necked people I should at once go up into your midst and destroy you Now immediately put aside your ornaments so that I may know what to do to youTherefore the sons of Israel put aside their ornaments before Mount HorebAlso Moses took the tabernacle and pitched it beyond the camp at a distance and he called its name Tabernacle of the Covenant And all the people who had any kind of question went out to the Tabernacle of the Covenant beyond the campAnd when Moses went out to the tabernacle all the people rose up and each one stood at the door of his pavilion and they beheld the back of Moses until he entered the tentAnd when he had gone into the Tabernacle of the Covenant the pillar of cloud descended and stood at the door and he spoke with MosesAnd all discerned that the pillar of cloud stood at the door of the Tabernacle And they stood and worshipped at the doors of their tentsBut the Lord spoke to Moses face to face just as a man is used to speaking to his friend And when he returned to the camp his minister Joshua the son of Nun a young man did not withdraw from the TabernacleThen Moses said to the Lord You instruct me to lead this people away and you do not reveal to me whom you will send with me particularly since you have said I know you by name and you have found favor before meIf therefore I have found favor in your sight show your face to me so that I may know you and may find grace before your eyes Look favorably on your people this nationAnd the Lord said My face will precede you and I will give you restAnd Moses said If you will not yourself precede us then do not lead us away from this placeFor how will we be able to know I and your people that we have found grace in your sight unless you walk with us so that we may be glorified out of all the people who live upon the earthThen the Lord said to Moses This word also which you have spoken I will do For you have found grace before me and I have known you by nameAnd he said Show me your gloryHe responded I will show you all that is good and I will call out with the name of the Lord before you And I will take pity on whomever I will and I will be lenient to whomever it will please meAnd again he said You are not able to see my face For man shall not see me and liveAnd again he said Behold there is a place with me and you shall stand upon the rockAnd when my glory will cross over I will set you in a cleft of the rock and I will protect you with my right hand until I pass byAnd I will take away my hand and you shall see my back But my face you are not able to seeAnd after this he said Cut out for yourself two tablets of stone similar to the first ones and I will write upon them the words which were held on the tablets that you brokeBe prepared in the morning so that you may immediately ascend onto Mount Sinai and you shall stand with me on the summit of the mountainLet no one ascend with you and do not let anyone be seen throughout the entire mountain Likewise do not let the oxen or the sheep pasture up against itAnd so he cut out two tablets of stone like those that were before And rising up in the night he ascended onto Mount Sinai just as the Lord had instructed him carrying with him the tabletsAnd when the Lord had descended in a cloud Moses stood with him calling upon the name of the LordAnd as he was crossing before him he said The Ruler the Lord God merciful and lenient patient and full of compassion and also truthfulwho preserves mercy a thousand fold who takes away iniquity and wickedness and also sin; and with you no one in and of himself is innocent You render the iniquity of the fathers to the sons and also to their descendants to the third and fourth generationAnd hurrying Moses bowed down prostrate to the ground; and worshipinghe said If I have found grace in your sight O Lord I beg you to walk with us (for the people are stiff-necked) and take away our iniquities and our sin and so possess usThe Lord responded I will enter into a pact in the sight of all I will perform signs which have never been seen on earth nor among any nation so that this people in whose midst you are may discern the terrible work of the Lord that I will doObserve everything that I command you this day I myself will drive out before your face the Amorite and the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Perizzite and the Hivite and the JebusiteBeware that you do not ever join in friendship with the inhabitants of that land which may be your ruinBut destroy their altars break their statues and cut down their sacred grovesDo not be willing to worship any strange god The jealous Lord is his name God is a rivalDo not enter into a pact with the men of those regions lest when they will have fornicated with their gods and worshiped their idols someone might call upon you to eat from what was immolatedNeither shall you take a wife for your son from their daughters lest after they themselves have fornicated they may cause your sons also to fornicate with their godsYou shall not make for yourselves any molten godsYou shall keep the solemnity of unleavened bread For seven days you shall eat unleavened bread just as I instructed you in the time of the month of what is new For in the month of springtime you departed from EgyptAll of the male kind which open the womb shall be mine from all the animals as much of oxen as of sheep it shall be mineThe firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a sheep But if you will not give a price for it it shall be slain The firstborn of your sons you shall redeem You shall not appear empty in my sightFor six days you shall work On the seventh day you shall cease to cultivate and to harvestYou shall observe the Solemnity of Weeks with the first-fruits of the grain from the harvest of your wheat and a Solemnity when the time of the year returns and everything is stored awayThree times a year all your males shall appear in the sight of the Almighty the Lord God of IsraelFor when I will have taken away the nations before your face and enlarged your borders no one shall lie in wait against your land when you will go up to appear in the sight of the Lord your God three times a yearYou shall not immolate the blood of my victim over leaven; and there shall not remain in the morning any of the victim of the Solemnity of the PassoverThe first of the fruits of your land you shall offer in the house of the Lord your God You shall not boil a young goat in the milk of its motherAnd the Lord said to Moses Write these words to you through which I have formed a covenant both with you and with IsraelTherefore he was in that place with the Lord for forty days and forty nights; he did not eat bread and he did not drink water and he wrote on the tablets the ten words of the covenantAnd when Moses descended from Mount Sinai he held the two tablets of the testimony and he did not know that his face was radiant from the sharing of words with the LordThen Aaron and the sons of Israel seeing that the face of Moses was radiant were afraid to approach close byAnd being called by him they turned back both Aaron and the leaders of the assembly And after he had spoken to themall the sons of Israel also now came to him And he instructed them in all the things that he had heard from the Lord on Mount SinaiAnd having completed these words he placed a veil over his faceBut when he entered to the Lord and was speaking with him he took it off until he exited And then he spoke to the sons of Israel all that had been commanded to himAnd they saw that the face of Moses when he came out was radiant but he covered his face again whenever he spoke to themTherefore when all the multitude of the sons of Israel had gathered together he said to them These are the things that the Lord has ordered to be doneFor six days you shall do work; the seventh day the Sabbath and the rest of the Lord will be holy to you; whoever will have done any work in it shall be killedYou shall not kindle a fire in any of your dwelling places throughout the day of the SabbathAnd Moses said to the entire crowd of the sons of Israel This is the word which the Lord has instructed sayingSeparate from among you the first-fruits to the Lord Let all who are willing and have a ready soul offer these to the Lord gold and silver and brasshyacinth and purple and twice-dyed scarlet and fine linen the hair of goatsand the skins of rams dyed red and violet skins setim woodand oil to prepare lights and to produce ointment and most sweet incenseonyx stones and gems to adorn the ephod and the breastplateAnd whoever among you is wise let him come and make what the Lord has commandedthe tabernacle certainly and its roof and also the covering the rings and the panels with the bars the tent pegs and the basesthe ark and its bars the propitiatory and the veil that is drawn before itthe table with its bars and vessels and the bread of the presencethe lampstand to hold up the lights its vessels and lamps and the oil to the nourish the firethe altar of incense and its bars and the oil of unction and the incense of aromatics the tent at the door of the tabernaclethe altar of holocaust and its grate of brass with the bars and vessels the washtub and its basethe curtains of the atrium with the columns and the bases the hanging at the doors of the vestibulethe tent pegs of the tabernacle and the atrium with their little cordsthe vestments which are to be used in the ministry of the Sanctuary the vestments of Aaron the high priest as well as those of his sons in order to exercise the priesthood to meAnd all the multitude of the sons of Israel departing from the sight of Mosesoffered the first-fruits to the Lord with a most ready and devout mind to accomplish the work of the tabernacle of the testimony Whatever was needed for worship and for the holy vestmentsmen along with women provided arm bands and earrings rings and bracelets And every vessel of gold was separated to be donated to the LordIf anyone had hyacinth and purple and twice-dyed scarlet fine linen and the hair of goats the skins of rams dyed red and violet skinsmetal of silver and brass they offered it to the Lord along with setim wood for various usesBut the skillful women also gave whatever they had spun hyacinth purple and vermillion as well as fine linenand the hair of goats donating everything of their own accordYet truly the leaders offered onyx stones and gems for the ephod and the breastplateand aromatics and oil to maintain the lights and to prepare ointment and also to produce incense with a most sweet odorAll the men and women offered donations with a devout mind so that the works might be done which the Lord had ordered by the hand of Moses All the sons of Israel dedicated voluntary offerings to the LordAnd Moses said to the sons of Israel Behold the Lord has called by name Bezalel the son of Uri the son of Hur from the tribe of Judahand he has filled him with the Spirit of God with wisdom and understanding and knowledge and all teachingto design and to fashion with gold and silver and brassand with engraving stones and with the skill of a carpenter Whatever can be skillfully inventedhe has given to his heart It is likewise with Oholiab the son of Ahisamach from the tribe of DanHe has taught both of them wisdom in order to do the work of carpentry tapestry and embroidery from hyacinth and purple and twice-dyed scarlet and fine linen and every textile and to discover whatever may be newTherefore Bezalel and Oholiab and every wise man to whom the Lord gave wisdom and intelligence so as to know how to work skillfully made that which was necessary for the uses of the Sanctuary and which the Lord had instructedAnd when Moses had called them and every man of learning to whom the Lord had given wisdom and who of their own accord had offered themselves in order to accomplish this workhe handed over to them all the donations of the sons of Israel And while they were pursuing this work the people offered what they had vowed each day in the morningThe artisans were compelled by this to goto Moses and to say The people offer more than is neededTherefore Moses ordered this to be recited with a voice of proclamation Let neither man nor woman offer anything further for the work of the Sanctuary And so they ceased from offering giftsbecause what was offered was sufficient and was more than an abundanceAnd all those who were wise of heart in order to accomplish the work of the tabernacle made ten curtains of fine twisted linen and hyacinth and purple and twice-dyed scarlet with diverse workmanship by the art of embroideryEach of these was twenty-eight cubits in length and in width four All the curtains were of one measureAnd he joined five curtains to one another and the other five he coupled to one anotherHe also made loops of hyacinth along the edge of one curtain on both sides and similarly along the edge of the other curtainso that the loops might meet against one another and might be joined togetherFor these he also cast fifty gold rings which would retain the loops of the curtains and so make the tabernacle oneHe also made eleven canopies from the hair of goats in order to cover the roof of the tabernacleone canopy held in length thirty cubits and in width four cubits All the canopies were of one measureFive of these he joined by themselves and the other six separatelyAnd he made fifty loops along the edge of one canopy and fifty along the edge of the other canopy so that they might be joined to one anotherand fifty buckles of brass with which the roof might be woven together so that from all the canopies there would be made one coveringHe also made a covering for the tabernacle from the skins of rams dyed-red; and another cover above it from violet skinsHe also made the standing panels of the tabernacle from setim woodTen cubits was the length of one panel and one and one half cubits comprised the widthThere were two dovetails along every panel so that one might be joined to the other Thus did he make all the panels of the tabernacleOf these twenty were toward the meridian area opposite the southwith forty bases of silver Two bases were set under one panel at each of two sides at the corners where the joints of the sides terminate in cornersLikewise at that side of the tabernacle which looks toward the north he made twenty panelswith forty bases of silver two bases for each boardYet truly opposite the west that is toward that part of the tabernacle which looks out toward the sea he made six panelsand two others at each corner of the tabernacle at the backwhich were joined from bottom to top and held together by one joint So did he make both corners on that sideSo then there were altogether eight panels and they had sixteen bases of silver with of course two bases under each panelHe also made bars from setim wood five to hold together the panels at one side of the tabernacleand five others to fit together the panels of the other side and in addition to these five other bars toward the western area of the tabernacle opposite the seaHe also made another bar which came through the middle of the panels from corner to cornerBut the panels themselves he overlaid with gold casting silver bases for them And he made their rings from gold through which the bars might be able to be drawn And he covered the bars themselves with layers of goldHe also made a veil from hyacinth and purple from vermillion as well as fine twisted linen with varied and distinctive embroideryand four columns of setim wood which along with their heads he overlaid with gold casting silver bases for themHe also made a tent at the entrance of the tabernacle from hyacinth purple vermillion and fine twisted linen wrought with embroideryand five columns with their heads which he covered with gold and he cast their bases from brassNow Bezalel also made the ark from setim wood having two and one half cubits in length and one and one half cubits in width and the height was also one and one half cubits And he clothed it with the purest gold inside and outAnd for it he made a crown of gold all aroundcasting four gold rings at its four corners two rings on one side and two on the otherLikewise he made bars from setim wood which he clothed with goldand he placed them into the rings which were at the sides of the ark to carry itHe also made the propitiatory that is the oracle from the finest gold two and one half cubits in length and one and one half cubits in widthand then two Cherubim of ductile gold which he positioned at the two sides of the propitiatoryone Cherub at the top of one side and the other Cherub at the top of the other side The two Cherubim were at each end of the propitiatoryspreading their wings and protecting the propitiatory and gazing toward it and toward one anotherHe also made the table from setim wood with a length of two cubits and a width of one cubit which had a height of one and one half cubitsAnd he surrounded it with the finest gold and for it he made a ledge of gold all aroundand for the ledge itself he made a polished crown of gold four fingers high and upon the same another crown of goldAnd he cast four gold rings which he set at the four corners at each foot of the tableopposite the crown And he placed the bars into them so that the table could be carriedLikewise the bars themselves he made from setim wood and he surrounded them with goldAnd he made vessels for the diverse uses of the table as well as the little cups and bowls and measuring cups and the censers from pure gold in which the libations would be offeredHe also made the lampstand formed from the finest gold The branches bowls and little spheres as well as the lilies proceeded from its barsix on the two sides three branches on one side and three on the otherThree bowls the size of a nut were on each branch with little spheres and lilies and three bowls in the likeness of a nut were on the other branch with the little spheres together with the lilies The workmanship of the six branches which proceeded from the shaft of the lampstand was equalNow on the shaft itself were four bowls the size of a nut and little spheres together with each one and liliesand little spheres under two branches in three places which together made six branches proceeding from one barThus both the little spheres and the branches were from the same thing all hand-worked from the purest goldHe also made the seven lamps with their candle snuffers and the vessels where the candles would be extinguished from the finest goldThe lampstand with all its vessels weighed a talent of goldHe also made the altar of incense from setim wood having one cubit on each of four sides and in height two From its corners proceeded hornsAnd he clothed it with the purest gold with its grating as well as the sides and the hornsAnd for it he made a crown of gold all around and two gold rings under the crown at each side so that the bars might be put into them and the altar could be carriedNow the bars themselves he also made from setim wood and he covered them with layers of goldHe also composed the oil for the ointment of sanctification and the incense from the purest aromatics with the skill of a perfumerHe also made the altar of holocaust from setim wood five cubits square and three in heightthe horns of which proceeded from the corners And he covered it with layers of brassAnd for its uses he prepared diverse vessels out of brass kettles forceps little hooks larger hooks and receptacles for the fireAnd he made its grating of brass in the manner of a net and under it in the midst of the altar its basecasting four rings at the four ends of the net in order to set the bars so as to carry itThese bars he also made of setim wood and he covered them with layers of brassAnd he drew them through the rings which projected from the sides of the altar But the altar itself was not solid but hollow made from panels and empty insideHe also made the washtub of brass with its base made from the mirrors of the women who kept watch at the door of the tabernacleHe also made the atrium at the south side of which were hangings of fine twisted linen of one hundred cubits andtwenty columns of brass with their bases The heads of the columns and all of the engraving work were of silverEqually at the northern area the hangings the columns and the bases and heads of the columns were of the same measure and work and metalYet truly on that side which looks out toward the west there were hangings of fifty cubits and ten columns with their bases of brass And the heads of the columns and all of the engraving work were of silverFurthermore toward the east he prepared hangings of fifty cubitsof which there were fifteen cubits among three columns with their bases holding up one sideand on the other side (for between the two he made the entrance of the tabernacle) there were equally hangings of fifteen cubits and three pillars and the same number of basesAll the hangings of the atrium were woven from fine twisted linenThe bases of the columns were of brass but their heads with all of their engravings were of silver Now he also overlaid the columns of the atrium themselves with silverAnd he made at its entrance a hanging wrought with embroidery of hyacinth purple vermillion and fine twisted linen which held twenty cubits in length yet truly it was five cubits in height as with the measure of all the hangings of the atriumNow the columns at the entrance were four with bases of brass and their heads and engravings were of silverLikewise the tent pegs of the tabernacle and the atrium all around he made of brassThese are the instruments of the tabernacle of the testimony which were enumerated according to the instruction of Moses with the ceremonies of the Levites by the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priestwhich Bezalel the son of Uri the son of Hur from the tribe of Judah had completed just as the Lord decreed through MosesHe was joined by his associate Oholiab the son of Ahisamach from the tribe of Dan who himself was also an exceptional artisan of wood and of weaving as well as of embroidery with hyacinth purple vermillion and fine linenAll of the gold that was expended in the work of the Sanctuary and that was offered in donation was twenty-nine talents and seven hundred thirty shekels according to the measure of the SanctuaryNow it was offered by those who were past the numbering of twenty years and above from six hundred and three thousand five hundred and fifty men able to bear armsThere were beyond that one hundred talents of silver from which were cast the bases for the Sanctuary and for the entrance where the veil hangsOne hundred bases were made from one hundred talents a single talent being counted for each baseBut from one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five he made the heads of the columns which he also clothed with silverLikewise of brass there was offered seventy-two thousand talents and four hundred more shekelsfrom which were cast the bases at the entrance of the tabernacle of the testimony and the altar of brass with its grating and the vessels which pertain to its useand the bases of the atrium as much at the circumference as at its entrance and the tent pegs of the tabernacle and of the atrium all roundTruly from hyacinth and purple vermillion and fine linen he made the vestments with which Aaron was clothed when he ministered in the holy places just as the Lord instructed MosesAnd so he made an ephod of gold hyacinth and purple and twice-dyed scarlet and fine twisted linenwrought with embroidery And he cut thin strips of gold and drew them into threads so that they could be twisted into the weave of the first colorsAnd he made two edges coupled to one another at the top of both sidesand a wide belt from the same colors just as the Lord had instructed MosesHe also prepared two onyx stones set and enclosed in gold and engraved with the skill of a jeweler with the names of the sons of IsraelAnd he set them in the sides of the ephod as a memorial to the sons of Israel just as the Lord had instructed MosesHe also made a breastplate wrought with embroidery according to the work of the ephod from gold hyacinth purple and twice-dyed scarlet and fine twisted linenwith four equal sides doubled of the measure of the palm of a handAnd he set four rows of gems in it In the first row was a sardius stone a topaz an emerald;in the second was a garnet a sapphire and a jasper;in the third was a zircon an agate and an amethyst;in the fourth was a chrysolite an onyx and a beryl surrounded and enclosed in gold by their rowsAnd these twelve stones were engraved with the names of the twelve tribes of Israel each one with a single nameThey also made in the breastplate little chains linked to one another from the purest goldand two hooks and the same number of gold rings Moreover they set the rings at both sides of the breastplatefrom which two golden chains would hang which they connected with the hooks that projected from the corners of the ephodThese were both in front and in back so that they met one another and so that the ephod and the breastplate were woven togetherbeing fastened to the wide belt and strongly coupled with rings to which a hyacinth band was joined lest they should shake loose and be moved away from one another just as the Lord instructed MosesThey also made the tunic of the ephod entirely from hyacinthwith the head in the upper part at the middle and a woven edge all around the headThen at the feet below they also made pomegranates from hyacinth purple vermillion and fine twisted linenand little bells from the purest gold which they set between the pomegranates at the very bottom of the tunic all aroundSo then the high priest approached adorned with gold bell and pomegranate when he performed his ministry just as the Lord had instructed MosesThey also made fine linen tunics with woven work for Aaron and his sonsand headdresses with their little crowns of fine linenand also linen undergarments of fine linenTruly they also made a wide band of fine twisted linen hyacinth purple as well as vermillion twice-dyed with skillful embroidery just as the Lord had instructed MosesThey also made the plate of sacred veneration from the purest gold and they wrote on it with the skill of a jeweler Holy to the LordAnd they fastened it to the headdress with a hyacinth band just as the Lord had instructed MosesAnd so all the work of the tabernacle and of the covering of the testimony was completed And the sons of Israel did all that the Lord had instructed MosesAnd they offered the tabernacle and the covering and all of the articles the rings the panels the bars the columns and basesthe cover of the skins of rams dyed red and the other cover of violet skinsthe veil the ark the bars the propitiatorythe table with its vessels and the bread of the presencethe lampstand the lamps and their utensils with the oilthe altar of gold and the ointment and the incense of aromaticsand the tent at the entrance of the tabernaclethe altar of brass the grating the bars and all of its vessels the washtub with its base the hangings of the atrium and the columns with their basesthe hanging at the entrance of the atrium and their little cords and pegs Nothing was lacking of the articles that were commanded to be made for the ministry of the tabernacle and for the covering of the covenantLikewise the vestments which the priests namely Aaron and his sons make use of use in the Sanctuarythe sons of Israel offered just as the Lord had instructedAfter this when Moses saw that everything was completed he blessed themAnd the Lord spoke to Moses sayingIn the first month on the first day of the month you shall raise the tabernacle of the testimonyand you shall place the ark in it and you shall release the veil before itAnd having brought in the table you shall place the things which were solemnly commanded upon it The lampstand shall stand with its lampsand the altar of gold in which the incense is burned shall stand before the ark of the testimony You shall place the tent at the entrance of the tabernacleand before it the altar of holocaustThe washtub shall stand between the altar and the tabernacle and you shall fill it with waterAnd you shall encompass the atrium and its entrance with hangingsAnd having taken up the oil of unction you shall anoint the tabernacle along with its articles so that they may be sanctifiedThe altar of holocaust and all its vesselsthe washtub with its base and all things you shall consecrate with the oil of unction so that they may be the Holy of holiesAnd you shall bring forward Aaron and his sons to the entrance of the tabernacle of the testimony and having washed them with wateryou shall clothe them in the holy vestments so that they may minister to me and so that their unction may accomplish an everlasting priesthoodAnd Moses did all that the Lord had instructedTherefore in the first month of the second year on the first day of the month the tabernacle was put in placeAnd Moses raised it up and he positioned the panels as well as the bases and the bars and he set up the columnsand he stretched out the roof over the tabernacle imposing a cover above it just as the Lord had decreedAnd he placed the testimony in the ark applying the bars beneath and the oracle aboveAnd when he had brought the ark into the tabernacle he drew the veil before it in order to fulfill the commandment of the LordAnd he placed the table in the tabernacle of the testimony at the north side beyond the veilarranging before it the bread of the presence just as the Lord had instructed MosesAnd he placed the lampstand in the tabernacle of the testimony away from the table on the south sidesetting the lamps in order according to the precept of the LordHe also positioned the altar of gold under the roof of the testimony opposite the veiland he heaped upon it the incense of aromatics just as the Lord had commanded MosesAnd he positioned the tent at the entrance of the tabernacle of the testimonyand the altar of holocaust in the vestibule of the testimony offering the holocaust and the sacrifices upon it just as the Lord had decreedLikewise he stationed the washtub between the tabernacle of the testimony and the altar filling it with waterAnd Moses and Aaron along with his sons washed their hands and feetwhenever they would enter the covering of the covenant and when they approached to the altar just as the Lord had instructed MosesAnd he raised up the atrium around the tabernacle and the altar drawing the hanging at its entrance After all these things were perfectedthe cloud covered the tabernacle of the testimony and the glory of the Lord filled itNeither could Moses enter the covering of the covenant the cloud was covering all things and the majesty of the Lord was flashing For the cloud had covered everythingWhenever the cloud departed from the tabernacle the sons of Israel set out by their companiesBut if it remained hanging over it they remained in the same placeCertainly the cloud of the Lord lay over the tabernacle by day and the fire by night being seen by all the people of Israel throughout all their resting placesThen the Lord called Moses and spoke to him from the tabernacle of the testimony sayingSpeak to the sons of Israel and you shall say to them The man among you who will offer to the Lord a sacrifice from the cattle that is an offering of victims of oxen or sheepif his offering will be a holocaust as well as from the herd he shall offer an immaculate male at the door of the tabernacle of the testimony to make himself pleasing to the LordAnd he shall place his hand on the head of the sacrifice and so it shall be acceptable and effective in its expiationAnd he shall immolate the calf in the sight of the Lord And the priests the sons of Aaron shall offer its blood pouring it all around the altar which is before the door of the tabernacleAnd having pulled away the skin of the victim they shall cut up the joints into piecesand they shall toss fire under the altar having arranged beforehand a stack of woodAnd they shall lay the parts which are cut up in order upon it namely the head and all the things that adjoin to the liverthe intestines and feet having been washed with water And the priest shall burn them on the altar as a holocaust and as a sweet odor to the LordBut if the offering is from the flocks a holocaust either of sheep or goats he shall offer a male without blemishAnd he shall immolate it at the side of the altar which looks out toward the north in the sight of the Lord Yet truly the sons of Aaron shall pour its blood upon the altar all aroundAnd they shall divide the limbs the head and everything that adjoins to the liver And they shall place them on the wood under which the fire is to be thrownYet truly the intestines and the feet they shall wash with water And the priest having offered everything shall burn it upon the altar as a holocaust and as a most sweet odor to the LordBut if the oblation of a holocaust to the Lord is of birds either of turtledoves or young pigeonsthe priest shall offer it at the altar and twisting back the neck with the head and also rupturing the place of the wound he shall make the blood run down over the edge of the altarYet truly the craw of the throat and the feathers he shall cast near the altar at the eastern section in the place where the ashes are usually poured outAnd he shall break its wing joints but he shall neither cut nor divide it with metal and he shall burn it upon the altar placing fire under the wood It is a holocaust and an oblation of a most sweet odor to the LordWhen a soul will offer an oblation of sacrifice to the Lord his oblation shall be of fine wheat flour and he shall pour oil over it and he shall set down frankincenseand he shall bring it to the sons of Aaron the priests One of them shall take a handful of the flour with oil as well as all the frankincense and he shall place it as a memorial upon the altar as a most sweet odor to the LordThen what will remain of the sacrifice shall be for Aaron and his sons the Holy of holies from the oblations of the LordBut when you will offer a sacrifice baked in the oven from fine wheat flour specifically loaves without leaven sprinkled with oil and unleavened wafers rubbed with oilif your oblation will be from the frying pan of flour tempered with oil and without leavenyou shall divide it into little pieces and pour oil over itBut if the sacrifice will be from the oven grating equally the fine wheat flour shall be sprinkled with oilWhen you are offering it to the Lord you shall deliver it into the hands of the priestAnd when he has offered it he shall take a memorial from the sacrifice and burn it upon the altar as a sweet odor to the LordBut whatever is left shall be for Aaron and his sons the Holy of holies from the oblations of the LordEvery oblation that is offered to the Lord shall be made without leaven neither shall any leaven or honey be burned with the sacrifice to the LordYou shall offer only the first-fruits of these along with the gifts Yet truly these shall not be placed upon the altar as an odor of sweetnessWhatever sacrifice you will offer you shall season it with salt neither shall you take away the salt of the covenant of your God from your sacrifice In all your oblations you shall offer saltBut if you will offer a gift of the first-fruits of your grain to the Lord from ears of grain still green you shall parch it at the fire and break it open in the manner of meal And so shall you offer your first-fruits to the Lordpouring oil over it and imposing frankincense because it is an oblation of the LordFrom this the priest shall burn as a memorial of the gift a portion of the cracked grain and the oil as well as all of the frankincenseBut if his oblation will be a sacrifice of peace offerings and he wishes to offer it from the oxen whether male or female he shall offer what is immaculate in the sight of the LordAnd he shall place his hand upon the head of his victim which shall be immolated at the entrance of the tabernacle of the testimony And the sons of Aaron the priests shall pour the blood all around the altarAnd they shall offer from the sacrifice of peace offerings as an oblation to the Lord the fat which covers the vital organs and whatever fat is interiorthe two kidneys with the fat that covers the sides and the mesh of the liver with the two little kidneysAnd they shall burn them upon the altar as a holocaust placing fire under the wood as an oblation of a most sweet odor to the LordYet truly if his oblation and the sacrifice of peace offerings will be from the sheep whether he will offer a male or a female they shall be immaculateIf he will offer a lamb in the sight of the Lordhe shall place his hand upon the head of the victim And it shall be immolated at the vestibule of the tabernacle of the testimony And the sons of Aaron shall pour its blood all around the altarAnd they shall offer from the victim of peace offerings as a sacrifice to the Lord the fat and the entire rumpwith the kidneys and the fat that covers the abdomen and all the vital organs and both the little kidneys with the fat that is near the sides and the mesh of the liver with the little kidneysAnd the priest shall burn them upon the altar as fuel for the fire and as an oblation of the LordIf his oblation will be a goat and he will offer it to the Lordhe shall place his hand upon its head and he shall immolate it at the entrance of the tabernacle of the testimony And the sons of Aaron shall pour its blood all around the altarAnd they shall take from it to feed the Lord’s fire the fat which covers the abdomen and that which covers all the vital organsthe two little kidneys with the mesh that is over them near the sides and the fat of the liver with the little kidneysAnd the priest shall burn them upon the altar as nourishment for the fire and as a most sweet odor All the fat shall be for the Lordby a perpetual law in your generations and in all of your habitations neither blood nor fat shall you eat at allAnd the Lord spoke to Moses sayingSay to the sons of Israel The soul which will have sinned through ignorance and concerning any of the commandments of the Lord that he instructed not to be done if anything at all has been doneif the priest who is anointed will have sinned causing the people to commit a transgression he shall offer to the Lord for his sin an immaculate calfAnd he shall lead it to the door of the tabernacle of the testimony in the sight of the Lord And he shall place his hand upon its head and he shall immolate it to the LordLikewise he shall take from the blood of the calf carrying it into the tabernacle of the testimonyand having dipped his finger into the blood he shall sprinkle it seven times in the sight of the Lord opposite the veil of the SanctuaryAnd he shall place some of the same blood over the horns of the altar of most pleasing incense to the Lord which is in the tabernacle of the testimony Then he shall pour out the remainder of the blood at the base of the altar of holocaust at the entrance of the tabernacleAnd on behalf of the sin he shall take the fat of the calf both that which covers the vital organs and all that is interiorthe two little kidneys and the mesh that is on them near the sides and the fat of the liver with the little kidneysjust as it is taken from the calf of the sacrifice of peace offerings And he shall burn them upon the altar of holocaustYet truly the skin and all the flesh with the head and the feet and the intestines and the dungand the remainder of the body he shall carry away beyond the camp to the clean place where the ashes are usually poured out And he shall burn them upon a stack of wood There in the place where the ashes have been poured out they will be burnedBut if all the crowd of Israel will have been ignorant and through inexperience will have done what is contrary to the commandment of the Lordand afterwards shall understand their sin they shall offer a calf on behalf of their sin and they shall lead it to the door of the tabernacleAnd the elders of the people shall place their hands upon its head in the sight of the Lord And when the calf has been immolated in the sight of the Lordthe priest who is anointed shall carry some of its blood into the tabernacle of the testimonyand he shall dip his finger in it sprinkling it seven times opposite the veilAnd he shall place some of the same blood on the horns of the altar which is in the presence of the Lord in the tabernacle of the testimony But the remainder of the blood he shall pour out at the base of the altar of holocaust which is at the door of the tabernacle of the testimonyAnd he shall take all its fat and burn it upon the altardoing so with this calf in the same manner as he did before And while the priest is praying for them the Lord will forgive themBut the calf itself he shall carry away beyond the camp and he shall also burn it just as with the previous calf because it is for the sin of the multitudeIf a leader will have sinned and through ignorance will have done one of the many things which the law of the Lord prohibitsand afterwards he shall understand his sin he shall offer an immaculate he-goat from among the goats as a sacrifice to the LordAnd he shall place his hand upon its head And when he will have immolated it in the place where the holocaust is usually slain in the sight of the Lord because it is for sinthe priest shall dip his finger in the blood of the victim for sin touching the horns of the altar of holocaust and pouring out the remainder at its baseYet truly the fat he shall burn upon it just as is usually done with the victims of peace offerings And the priest shall pray for him and for his sin and he shall be released from itBut if a soul from the people of the land will have sinned through ignorance so as to have done any of those things that the law of the Lord prohibits and so commit a transgressionand he shall realize his sin he shall offer an immaculate she-goatAnd he shall place his hand upon the head of the victim which is for sin And he shall immolate it in the place of the holocaustAnd the priest shall take some of the blood with his finger and touching the horns of the altar of holocaust he shall pour out the remainder at its baseBut taking away all the fat just as it is usually taken away from the victims of peace offerings he shall burn it upon the altar as a sweet odor to the Lord And he shall pray for him and he shall be released from itBut if instead he will offer from the flock a victim for his sin specifically an immaculate female sheephe shall place his hand upon its head and he shall immolate it in the place where the victims of holocausts are usually slainAnd the priest shall take some of its blood with his finger and touching the horns of the altar of holocaust he shall pour out the remainder at its baseLikewise all of the fat shall be taken away just as the fat of the ram which is immolated for peace offerings is usually taken away And he shall burn it upon the altar as an incense of the Lord And he shall pray for him and for his sin and he shall be released from itIf a soul will have sinned and heard the voice of one testifying under oath and he is a witness because either he has seen it himself or he is aware of it if he does not reveal it he shall carry his iniquityThe soul that will have touched anything unclean either that which has been killed by a beast or that which has died on its own or any other creeping thing and will have forgotten its uncleanness he is guilty and has committed a transgressionAnd if he will have touched anything from the uncleanness of man according to every kind of impurity by which he may be defiled and having forgotten it afterwards realizes it he shall be guilty of committing a transgressionThe soul who swears and offers from his own lips that he would do either evil or good and who will have bound the same with an oath and with his own words and having forgotten it afterwards understands his transgressionlet him do penance for his sinand let him offer from the flocks a female lamb or a she-goat and the priest shall pray for him and for his sinBut if he is not able to offer a beast let him offer two turtledoves or two young pigeons to the Lord one for sin and the other for a holocaustAnd he shall give them to the priest who offering the first for sin shall twist back its head to the little wings so that it adheres to the neck and is not entirely broken offAnd he shall sprinkle some of its blood at the side of the altar But whatever will remain he shall cause it to drip down to the base because it is for sinYet truly the other he shall burn as a holocaust just as is usually done And the priest shall pray for him and for his sin and he shall be released from itBut if his hand is unable to offer two turtledoves or two young pigeons he shall offer for his sin the tenth part of an ephah of fine wheat flour He shall not put oil in it nor place upon it any frankincense because it is for sinAnd he shall deliver it to the priest who shall take a handful of it and shall burn it upon the altar as a memorial for him who offered itpraying for him and making atonement Yet truly the remaining part he himself shall have as a giftAnd the Lord spoke to Moses sayingIf a soul by mistake shall have transgressed the ceremonies in those things that are sanctified to the Lord he shall offer for his offense an immaculate ram from the flocks such as can be bought for two shekels according to the weight of the SanctuaryAnd he shall make restitution for the damage that he has brought and he shall add a fifth part more delivering it to the priest who shall pray for him while offering the ram and he shall be released from itIf a soul will have sinned through ignorance and will have done one of those things which the law of the Lord prohibits and being guilty of sin understands his iniquityhe shall offer from the flocks an immaculate ram to the priest according to the measure and estimation of the sin who shall pray for him because he did it unknowingly and he shall be released from itbecause by mistake he transgressed against the LordThe Lord spoke to Moses sayingThe soul who will have sinned and despising the Lord will have denied to his neighbor the deposit which he had entrusted to his safekeeping or who will have extorted anything by force or who will have made a false accusationor who will have found a lost thing and then also withheld it by swearing falsely or who will have done any other of the many things by which men usually sinbeing convicted of the offense he shall restoreall that he wanted to obtain by fraud the whole plus an additional fifth part to the owner against whom he brought the damageThen on behalf of his sin he shall offer an immaculate ram from the flock and he shall give it to the priest according to the estimation and measure of the offenseAnd he shall pray for him in the sight of the Lord and he shall be released from any one of those things that he did when he sinnedAnd the Lord spoke to Moses sayingInstruct Aaron and his sons This is the law of a holocaust It shall be burned upon the altar all night until morning The fire shall be from the same altarThe priest shall be vested with the tunic and the linen undergarments And he shall take up the ashes of that which the devouring fire has consumed and placing them next to the altarhe shall strip off his former vestments and being clothed with others he shall carry them beyond the camp and he shall cause them to be consumed even to glowing embers in a very clean placeBut the fire on the altar shall burn always for the priest shall nourish it by placing wood under it each day in the morning And laying down the holocaust he shall burn the fat of the peace offerings upon itThis is the perpetual fire which shall never fail upon the altarThis is the law of the sacrifice and the libations which the sons of Aaron shall offer in the sight of the Lord and before the altarThe priest shall take a handful of fine wheat flour which has been sprinkled with oil and all the frankincense which has been placed upon the flour and he shall burn it upon the altar as a memorial of most sweet odor to the LordAnd the remaining portion of the flour Aaron shall eat with his sons without leaven And he shall eat it in the holy place in the atrium of the tabernacleYet for this reason it shall not be leavened because part of it is offered as an incense of the Lord The Holy of holies shall it be just as what is offered on behalf of sin and of transgressionOnly the males of the stock of Aaron shall eat it This shall be an everlasting ordinance in your generations concerning the sacrifices of the Lord All who will touch these shall be sanctifiedAnd the Lord spoke to Moses sayingThis is the oblation of Aaron and of his sons which they must offer to the Lord in the day of their anointing They shall offer a tenth part of an ephah of fine wheat flour as a perpetual sacrifice half of it in the morning and half of it in the eveningIt shall be sprinkled with oil and fried in a frying pan Then it shall be offered hot as a most sweet odor to the Lordby the priest who by law succeeds his father And it shall be entirely burned on the altarFor every sacrifice of the priest shall be consumed by fire neither shall anyone eat from itThen the Lord spoke to Moses sayingSay to Aaron and his sons This is the law of the victim for sin In the place where the holocaust is offered it shall be immolated in the sight of the Lord It is the Holy of holiesThe priest who offers it shall eat it in the holy place in the atrium of the tabernacleWhatever will touch its flesh shall be sanctified If a garment will be sprinkled with its blood it shall be washed in a holy placeThen the earthen vessel in which it was soaked shall be broken But if the vessel will be of brass it shall be scoured and washed with waterEvery male of priestly descent shall feed on its flesh because it is the Holy of holiesFor the victim that is slain for sin whose blood is carried into the tabernacle of the testimony for expiation in the Sanctuary shall not be eaten but it shall be consumed by fireLikewise this is the law of the sacrifice for a transgression It is the Holy of holiesTherefore where the holocaust is immolated the victim for a transgression shall also be slain Its blood shall be poured out all around the altarThey shall offer from it the rump and the fat that covers the vital organsthe two little kidneys and the fat that is near the sides and the mesh of the liver with the little kidneysAnd the priest shall burn them upon the altar It is the incense of the Lord on behalf of a transgressionEvery male of priestly descent shall feed on this flesh in a holy place because it is the Holy of holiesJust as the sacrifice for sin is offered so also for a transgression one law shall be for both sacrifices It shall belong to the priest who offers itThe priest who offers the victim of holocaust shall have its skinAnd every sacrifice of fine wheat flour which is baked in the oven and whatever is prepared on the oven grating or in the frying pan shall be for the priest who offers itWhether these will be sprinkled with oil or left dry an equal measure shall be divided to each one of the sons of AaronThis is the law of the victim of peace offerings which is offered to the LordIf the oblation will be an act for giving thanks they shall offer bread without leaven sprinkled with oil and unleavened wafers anointed with oil and fine wheat flour fried and cakes sprinkled and mixed with oiland also leavened bread with the sacrifice of thanksgiving which is immolated for peace offeringsOf these one shall be offered to the Lord as the first-fruits and one shall be for the priest who will pour out the blood of the victimThe flesh of it shall be eaten on the same day neither shall any of it remain until morningIf anyone by a vow or of his own accord will have offered a sacrifice it shall be eaten in a similar manner on the same day But then if any of it will have remained until tomorrow it is lawful to eat itThen whatever will be found on the third day shall be consumed with fireIf anyone will have eaten from the flesh of the victim of peace offerings on the third day the oblation will be nullified neither will it benefit the one who offered it But instead whatever soul will contaminate itself with such foods will be guilty of a betrayalThe flesh that has touched anything unclean shall not be eaten but it shall be burnt with fire He that is clean will feed on itIf a soul which is polluted will have eaten from the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings which is offered to the Lord he shall perish from his peopleAnd whoever will have touched the uncleanness of man or of beast or of anything which is able to defile and who will have eaten from this kind of flesh shall be cut off from his peopleAnd the Lord spoke to Moses sayingSay to the sons of Israel The fat of a sheep and of an ox and of a goat you shall not eatThe fat of a carcass that has died on its own or of an animal that has been seized by a wild beast you shall have for various usesIf anyone will have eaten the fat which ought to be offered as a burnt sacrifice of the Lord he shall perish from his peopleLikewise you shall not take as food the blood of any animals at all whether of birds or beastsEvery soul that will have eaten blood shall perish from his peopleAnd the Lord spoke to Moses sayingSpeak to the sons of Israel saying Whoever offers a victim of peace offerings to the Lord let him also offer at the same time a sacrifice that is its libationsHe shall hold in his hands the fat of the victim and the breast And when he will have offered and consecrated both to the Lord he shall deliver them to the priestwho shall burn the fat upon the altar But the breast shall be for Aaron and his sonsLikewise also the right shoulder of the victim of peace offerings shall fall to the priest as first-fruitsAmong the sons of Aaron whoever will have offered the blood and the fat the same one shall also have the right shoulder for his portionSo then the breast that is lifted up and the shoulder that is separated I have taken from the sons of Israel from their victims of peace offerings and I have given these to Aaron the priest and to his sons as a law in perpetuity from all the people of IsraelThis is the anointing of Aaron and his sons by the ceremonies of the Lord in the day when Moses offered them so that they may fulfill the priesthoodand this is what the Lord instructed to be given to them by the sons of Israel as a perpetual observance in their generationsThis is the law of the holocaust and of the sacrifice for sin and for transgression and for consecration and for the victims of peace offeringswhich the Lord appointed to Moses on mount Sinai when he commanded the sons of Israel to offer their oblations to the Lord in the desert of SinaiAnd the Lord spoke to Moses sayingTake Aaron with his sons their vestments and the oil of anointing a calf for sin two rams and a basket with unleavened breadand gather together all the assembly at the door of the tabernacleAnd Moses did as the Lord had commanded And when all the crowd was gathered together before the entrance of the tabernaclehe said This is the word that the Lord has ordered to be doneAnd immediately he brought forward Aaron and his sons And when he had washed themhe vested the high priest with the linen undergarment wrapped him with the wide belt and clothed him with the hyacinth tunic and over it he imposed the ephodAnd tying it to the belt he fitted it to the breastplate on which was Doctrine and TruthAlso he wrapped the headdress on his head and over it opposite the forehead he placed the plate of gold consecrated with sanctification just as the Lord had instructed himHe also took up the oil of anointing with which he anointed the tabernacle along with all of its articlesAnd when he had sprinkled the altar seven times to sanctify it he anointed it and all its vessels And the washtub with its base he sanctified with the oilAnd pouring the oil over Aaron’s head he anointed and consecrated himLikewise after he had offered his sons he vested them with linen tunics and wrapped them with wide belts and placed headdresses on them just as the Lord had orderedHe also offered the calf for sin And when Aaron and his sons had placed their hands upon its headhe immolated it And drawing the blood and dipping his finger in it he touched the horns of the altar all around And when it was expiated and sanctified he poured out the remainder of the blood at its baseYet truly the fat which was on the vital organs and the mesh of the liver and the two little kidneys with their fat he burned upon the altarAnd the calf with the skin and the flesh and the dung he burned beyond the camp just as the Lord had instructedHe also offered a ram as a holocaust And when Aaron and his sons had imposed their hands upon its headhe immolated it and he poured out its blood around the altarAnd cutting the ram into pieces he burned its head and the limbs and the fat in the firehaving first washed the intestines and the feet And then he burned the whole of the ram upon the altar because it was a holocaust of most sweet odor to the Lord just as he had instructed himHe also offered the second ram as a consecration of priests And Aaron and his sons placed their hands upon its headAnd when Moses had immolated it taking up some of its blood he touched the tip of Aaron’s right ear and the thumb of his right hand and similarly also his footHe also offered the sons of Aaron And when from the blood of the ram which was immolated he had touched the tip of the right ear of each one and the thumbs of their right hands as well as their feet he poured out the remainder upon the altar all aroundYet truly the fat and the rump and all the fat that covers the intestines and the mesh of the liver and the two kidneys with their fat and the right shoulder he separatedThen taking bread without leaven from the basket of unleavened bread which was before the Lord and a cake sprinkled with oil and a wafer he placed them upon the fat and the right shoulderdelivering all these to Aaron and his sons And when they had lifted them up in the sight of the Lordhe received them again from their hands and he burned them upon the altar of holocaust because it was an oblation of consecration as a sweet odor of sacrifice to the LordAnd he took his portion from the ram of consecration and he lifted up its breast in the sight of the Lord just as the Lord had instructed himAnd taking up the ointment and the blood that was on the altar he sprinkled it over Aaron and his vestments and over his sons and their vestmentsAnd when he had sanctified them with their vestments he instructed them saying Cook the flesh before the entrance of the tabernacle and eat it there Likewise eat the loaves of consecration which have been placed in the basket just as the Lord instructed me saying ‘Aaron and his sons shall eat them’Then whatever will remain of the flesh and the loaves shall be consumed with fireAlso you shall not exit from the door of the tabernacle for seven days until the day on which the time of your consecration shall be completed For in seven days the consecration is finishedeven as it has begun at this present time so that the rite of the sacrifice might be accomplishedDay and night you shall remain in the tabernacle observing the watches of the Lord otherwise you shall die For so it has been commanded to meAnd Aaron and his sons did everything that the Lord spoke by the hand of MosesThen the eighth day having arrived Moses called Aaron and his sons and those greater by birth from Israel and he said to AaronTake a calf for sin from the herd and a ram as a holocaust both immaculate and offer them in the sight of the LordAnd to the sons of Israel you shall say ‘Take a he-goat for sin and a calf as well as a lamb both one-year-old and without blemish as a holocaustTake also an ox and a ram for peace offerings And immolate them before the Lord offering with the sacrifice of each one fine wheat flour sprinkled with oil For today the Lord will appear to you’ And so they brought everything that Moses had ordered before the door of the tabernacle where when all the multitude stood togetherMoses said This is the word which the Lord has instructed Accomplish it and his glory will appear to youAnd he said to Aaron Approach toward the altar and immolate on behalf of your sin Offer the holocaust and pray for yourself and for the people And when you have slain the victim for the people pray for them just as the Lord has instructedAnd immediately Aaron approaching toward the altar immolated the calf for his sinAnd his sons brought its blood to him and dipping his finger in it he touched the horns of the altar and he poured out the remainder at its baseAnd the fat and the little kidneys and the mesh of the liver which are for sin he burned upon the altar just as the Lord had instructed MosesYet truly the flesh and its skins he burned with fire beyond the campHe also immolated the victim of holocaust And his sons brought its blood to him which he poured out all around the altarAnd when the victim itself was cut into pieces they brought him the head and each of the limbs all of which he burned with fire upon the altarhaving first washed the intestines and the feet with waterAnd making an offering for the sin of the people he slew the he-goat And expiating the altarhe accomplished the holocaustadding to it the sacrifice of the libations which are to be offered together and burning them upon the altar separately from the ceremonies of the morning holocaustHe also immolated the ox as well as the ram as peace offerings for the people And his sons brought him the blood which he poured out upon the altar all aroundThen the fat of the ox and the rump of the ram and the two little kidneys with their fat and the mesh of the liverthey placed upon the breasts And when the fat had been burned upon the altarAaron separated their breasts and the right shoulders lifting them up in the sight of the Lord as Moses had instructedAnd extending his hands to the people he blessed them And so the victims for sin and the holocausts and the peace offerings being completed he descendedThen Moses and Aaron entered the tabernacle of the testimony and afterwards came out and blessed the people And the glory of the Lord appeared to the entire multitudeAnd behold a fire from the Lord devoured the holocaust and the fat which was on the altar When the crowd had seen this they praised the Lord falling on their facesAnd the sons of Aaron Nadab and Abihu picking up their censers placed fire in them and incense upon them offering in the sight of the Lord a strange fire such as was not instructed of themAnd fire coming out from the Lord destroyed them and they died in the sight of the LordAnd Moses said to Aaron This is what the Lord has spoken ‘I will be sanctified in those who approach me and I will be glorified in the sight of all the people’  And upon hearing this Aaron was silentThen Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan the sons of Uzziel the paternal uncle of Aaron and he said to them Go and take your brothers from the sight of the Sanctuary and carry them beyond the campAnd moving quickly they took them as they lay vested with linen tunics and cast them outside just as had been commanded themAnd Moses said to Aaron and to his sons Eleazar and Ithamar Do not uncover your heads and do not rend your garments lest perhaps you may die and indignation may rise up over the entire assembly Let your brothers and all the house of Israel bewail the burning that the Lord has kindledBut you shall not depart from the door of the tabernacle otherwise you shall perish For certainly the oil of holy anointing is upon you And they did all things according to the precept of MosesThe Lord also said to AaronYou shall not drink wine nor anything that is able to inebriate you or your sons when you enter into the tabernacle of the testimony lest you die For it is an everlasting precept in your generationsAnd so may you have the knowledge to discern between holy and profane between polluted and cleanAnd so may you teach the sons of Israel all my ordinances which the Lord has spoken to them by the hand of MosesAnd Moses spoke to Aaron and to his sons Eleazar and Ithamar who were remaining Take the sacrifice which remains from the oblation of the Lord and eat it without leaven next to the altar because it is the Holy of holiesFor you shall eat it in a holy place which is given to you and to your sons from the oblations of the Lord just as has been instructed meLikewise the breast which is offered and the shoulder which is separated you shall eat in a most clean place you and your sons and your daughters with you For these have been set aside for you and your children from the victims which benefit the sons of IsraelSince they have lifted up in the sight of the Lord the shoulder and the breast and the fat that is burned on the altar these also belong to you and to your sons as a perpetual law just as the Lord has instructedMeanwhile when Moses was searching for the he-goat which had been offered for sin he discovered it burned up And being angry against Eleazar and Ithamar the sons of Aaron who were remaining he saidWhy did you not eat the sacrifice for sin in the holy place which is the Holy of holies and which was given to you so that you might carry the iniquity of the people and might pray for them in the sight of the Lordespecially since none of its blood has been brought into the holy places and since you should have eaten it in the Sanctuary as was instructed meAaron responded This day the victim for sin has been offered and the holocaust in the sight of the Lord But you see what has happened to me How could I eat it or please the Lord in the ceremonies having a sorrowful mindBut when Moses had heard this he was satisfiedAnd the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron sayingSay to the sons of Israel These are the animals that you ought to eat out of all the living things of the earthAll that has a divided hoof and that chews over again among the cattle you shall eatBut whatever certainly chews over again but has a hoof that is not divided such as the camel and others these you shall not eat and you shall consider them to be among what is uncleanThe rock rabbit which chews over again and whose hoof is not divided is uncleanand so also is the hare for it too chews over again yet its hoof is not dividedand also the swine which though its hoof is divided does not chew over againThe flesh of these you shall not eat nor shall you touch their carcasses because they are unclean to youThese are the things that breed in the waters and which it is lawful to eat All that has little fins and scales as much in the sea as in the rivers and ponds you shall eatBut whatever does not have fins and scales of those things that live and move in the waters shall be abominable to youand detestable their flesh you shall not eat and their carcasses you shall avoidAll that does not have fins and scales in the waters shall be pollutedThese are those things among the birds which you must not eat and which are to be avoided by you the eagle and the griffin and the ospreyand the kite as well as the vulture according to their kindand all that is of the raven kind according to their likenessthe ostrich and the owl and the gull and the hawk according to its kindthe owl and the sea bird and the ibisand the swan and the pelican and the marsh henthe heron and the plover according to its kind the crested hoopoe and also the batOf all that flies whatever steps upon four feet shall be abominable to youBut whatever certainly walks upon four feet and also has longer legs behind with which it hops upon the earthyou shall eat such as the beetle in its kind and the cricket and grasshopper and the locust each one according to its kindBut among flying things whatever has only four feet shall be detestable to youAnd whoever will have touched their carcasses shall be defiled and he shall be unclean until eveningAnd if it will be necessary to carry any of these dead things he shall wash his clothes and he shall be unclean until the sun setsEvery animal that certainly has a hoof but which is not divided nor does it chew over again shall be unclean And whoever will have touched it shall be contaminatedWhatever walks upon its hands out of all the animals that advance on all fours shall be unclean Whoever will have touched their carcasses shall be polluted until eveningAnd whoever will have carried this kind of carcass shall wash his clothes and he shall be unclean until evening For all these are unclean to youLikewise these shall be considered among the polluted things out of all that moves upon the earth the weasel and the mouse and the crocodile each one according to its kindthe shrew and the chameleon and the gecko and the lizard and the moleAll these are unclean Whoever will have touched their carcasses shall be unclean until eveningAnd anything upon which something from their carcasses will have fallen shall be defiled whether it is a vessel of wood or a garment or skins or haircloths or anything by which work is done These shall be dipped in water and shall be defiled until evening but then afterwards these shall be cleanBut an earthen vessel into which something from these will fall shall be defiled and therefore it is to be brokenAny of the foods that you eat if water from such a vessel will have been poured upon it it shall be unclean And every liquid which one may drink from such a vessel shall be uncleanAnd if anything from among these kinds of dead things has fallen upon it it shall be unclean whether it be an oven or a pot with feet these shall be unclean and shall be destroyedYet truly fountains and cisterns and all reservoirs of water shall be clean Whoever will have touched their carcasses shall be defiledIf it falls upon seed grain it shall not defile itBut if anyone has poured water upon the seed grain and afterwards it was touched by the carcasses it shall be immediately defiledIf any animals will have died from which it is lawful for you to eat whoever will have touched its carcass shall be unclean until eveningAnd whoever will have eaten or carried anything of these shall wash his clothes and he shall be unclean until eveningAll that creeps across the earth shall be abominable neither shall it be taken up as foodWhatever advances by four feet upon the chest or that has many feet or that drags across the soil you shall not eat because it is abominableDo not be willing to contaminate your souls nor shall you touch any of these lest you become uncleanFor I am the Lord your God Be holy for I am Holy Do not pollute your souls with any creeping thing which moves across the landFor I am the Lord who led you away from the land of Egypt so that I would be your God you shall be holy for I am HolyThis is the law of animals and flying things and of every living soul that moves in the waters or creeps upon the landso that you may know the difference between clean and unclean and so that you may know what you ought to eat and what you ought to refuseAnd the Lord spoke to Moses sayingSpeak to the sons of Israel and you shall say to them A woman if she has received the seed to bear a male shall be unclean for seven days just as in the days of separation due to menstruationAnd on the eighth day the little infant shall be circumcisedYet truly she herself shall remain for thirty-three days in the blood of her purification She shall not touch anything holy nor shall she enter into the Sanctuary until the days of her purification are completedBut if she will bear a female she shall be unclean for two weeks according to the custom of her monthly flow and she shall remain in the blood of her purification for sixty-six daysAnd when the days of her purification have been completed for a son or for a daughter she shall bring to the door of the tabernacle of the testimony a one-year-old lamb as a holocaust and a young pigeon or a turtledove for sin and she shall deliver them to the priestHe shall offer them in the sight of the Lord and he shall pray for her And so she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood This is the law for one who bears a male or a femaleAnd if her hand has not obtained or been able to offer a lamb she shall take two turtledoves or two young pigeons one as a holocaust and the other for sin And the priest shall pray for her and so she shall be cleansedAnd the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron sayingThe man in whose skin or flesh there will have arisen a diverse color or a pustule or something that seems to shine which is the mark of leprosy shall be brought to Aaron the priest or to anyone you wish among his sonsAnd if he sees that leprosy is in his skin and that the hair has turned a white color and that the place where the leprosy appears is lower than the rest of the skin and the flesh then it is the mark of leprosy and at his judgment he shall be separatedBut if there will be a shining whiteness in the skin but it is not lower than the rest of the flesh and the hair is of unaffected color the priest shall seclude him for seven daysAnd on the seventh day he shall examine him and if the leprosy certainly has not increased further and has not spread itself in the skin he shall seclude him again for another seven daysAnd on the seventh day he shall evaluate him If the leprosy has become obscured and has not increased in the skin he shall declare him clean because it is a scab And the man shall wash his clothes and he shall be cleanBut if the leprosy increases again after he was seen by the priest and restored to cleanness he shall be brought to himand he shall be condemned of uncleannessIf the mark of leprosy has been in a man he shall be brought to the priestand he shall look upon him And when there is a white color in the skin and it has an altered appearance in its hair and also the same flesh seems aliveit shall be judged a chronic leprosy which has grown into the skin And so the priest shall declare him contaminated and he shall not seclude him because he is clearly uncleanBut if the leprosy will have flourished coursing through the skin and will have covered all the skin from the head even to the feet whatever falls under the sight of the eyesthe priest shall examine him and he shall judge that the leprosy that he possesses is very clean because it has all turned to whiteness and for this reason the man shall be cleanYet truly when the living flesh shall appear in himthen by the judgment of the priest he shall be polluted and he shall be considered to be among the unclean For the live flesh if it is spotted with leprosy is uncleanAnd if again it will have turned into whiteness and will have covered the entire manthe priest shall examine him and he shall discern him to be cleanBut when there has been an ulcer in the flesh and the skin and it has healedand in the place of the ulcer there appears a white or reddish scar the man shall be brought to the priestAnd when he will have seen the place of the leprosy lower than the rest of the flesh and that the hair has turned white he shall declare him contaminated For the plague of leprosy has arisen from the ulcerBut if the hair is of the usual color and the scar is somewhat obscure and is not lower than the nearby flesh he shall seclude him for seven daysAnd if it will have certainly increased he shall judge him to have leprosyBut if it stays in its place it is the scar of an ulcer and the man shall be cleanBut if flesh and skin has been burned by fire and having been healed now has a white or red scarthe priest shall examine it and if he sees that it has turned white and that its place is lower than the rest of the skin he shall declare him contaminated for the mark of leprosy has arisen in the scarBut if the color of the hair has not been changed nor is the mark lower than the rest of the flesh and the leprosy itself appears to be somewhat obscure he shall seclude him for seven daysand on the seventh day he shall evaluate him If the leprosy will have increased further in the skin he shall declare him contaminatedBut if the whiteness stays in its place and is not very clear it is the mark of a burn and for this reason he shall be declared clean because it is only the scar from a burnIf leprosy will have sprung up in the head or the beard of a man or woman the priest shall look upon themand if the place is certainly lower than the rest of the flesh and the hair is golden and thinner than usual he shall declare them contaminated because it is the leprosy of the head and the beardBut if he sees that the place of the spot is equal with the nearby flesh and that the hair is black he shall seclude him for seven daysand on the seventh day he shall examine it If the spot has not increased and the hair has kept its color and the place of the mark is equal with the rest of the fleshthe man shall be shaven except in the place of the spot and he shall be secluded for another seven daysOn the seventh day if the mark seems to have stayed in its place and it is not lower than the rest of the flesh he shall declare him clean and his clothes having been washed he shall be cleanBut if after his cleansing the spot will have increased again in the skinhe shall no longer inquire as to whether the hair has turned yellow because he is plainly uncleanFurthermore if the spot has not increased and the hair is black let him know that the man is healed and let him confidently pronounce him cleanIf a whiteness will have appeared in the skin of a man or a womanthe priest shall examine them If he detects an obscured whiteness shining in the skin may he know that it is not leprosy but a white-colored blemish and that the man is cleanThe man whose hair falls off of his head is bald and cleanAnd if the hair falls off of his forehead he is bald in front and cleanBut if in the bald head or bald forehead there has arisen a white or reddish colorand the priest will have seen this he shall condemn him without doubt of leprosy which has arisen in the baldnessTherefore whoever will have been spotted by leprosy and who has been separated at the judgment of the priestshall have his clothes unstitched his head bare his mouth covered with a cloth and he himself shall cry out that he is contaminated and filthyThe entire time that he is a leper and unclean he shall live alone outside the campA woolen or linen garment that will have held the leprosyin the main fibers or in any of the threads or certainly in a skin or whatever has been made from a skinif it has been infected with a white or red spot it shall be considered to be leprosy and it shall be shown to the priestAnd he having examined it shall close it up for seven daysAnd on the seventh day having looked at it again if he detects an increase it is a persistent leprosy he shall judge the garment to be polluted along with everything with which it has been foundAnd because of this it shall be burned in flamesBut if he will have seen that it has not increasedhe shall instruct them and they shall wash whatever has the leprosy in it and he shall close it up for another seven daysAnd when he will have seen that the former appearance has not returned even if the leprosy has not increased he shall judge it to be unclean and he shall burn it with fire for the leprosy has been infused in the exterior of the garment or throughout the wholeBut if the place of the leprosy has become somewhat darker after the garment has been washed he shall tear it away and separate it from the part that is soundBut if after this there will appear in those places which before were immaculate a flying and wandering leprosy it must be burned with fireIf it will have ceased he shall wash with water the parts which are pure for a second time and they shall be cleanThis is the law about leprosy for any woolen or linen garment in the weave and in the threads and for all items made from skins how it must be declared either clean or contaminatedAnd the Lord spoke to Moses sayingThis is the rite for a leper when he is to be cleansed He shall be brought to the priestwho departing from the camp when he has found the leprosy to be cleansedshall instruct him who is to be purified to offer for himself two living sparrows which it is lawful to eat and cedar wood and vermillion and hyssopAnd he shall order that one of the sparrows be immolated in an earthen vessel over living watersBut the other living one with the cedar wood and the scarlet and the hyssop he shall dip in the blood of the immolated sparrowAnd he shall sprinkle him who is to be cleansed seven times so that he may be purified justly And he shall release the living sparrow so that it may fly away into the fieldAnd when the man will have washed his clothes he shall shave all the hair from his body and he shall be washed with water And having been purified he shall enter into the camp only to this extent that he may remain outside his own tent for seven daysAnd on the seventh day he shall shave the hair of his head and his beard and his eyebrows as well as the hair of his entire body And having washed his clothes again and his bodyon the eighth day he shall take two immaculate lambs and a one-year-old female sheep without blemish and three tenths of fine wheat flour which has been sprinkled with oil as a sacrifice and separately one twelfth hin of oilAnd when the priest purifying the man has presented him and all these things in the sight of the Lord at the door of the tabernacle of the testimonyhe shall take a lamb and offer it for transgression with the twelfth hin of oil And having offered all these before the Lordhe shall immolate the lamb where the victim for sin is usually immolated with the holocaust that is in the holy place For just as with the one for sin so also the victim for transgression belongs to the priest It is the Holy of holiesAnd taking some of the blood of the victim which was immolated for transgression the priest shall place it upon the tip of the right ear of him who is being cleansed and upon the thumb of his right hand and likewise the footAnd he shall send some of the twelfth hin of oil into his own left handand he shall dip his right finger in it and he shall sprinkle it in the sight of the Lord seven timesBut the oil which remains in his left hand he shall pour over the tip of the right ear of him who is being cleansed and upon the thumb of his right hand as well as the foot and upon the blood which was shed for transgressionand upon his headAnd he shall pray for him in the sight of the Lord and he shall accomplish the sacrifice on behalf of sin Then he shall immolate the holocaustand place it upon the altar with its libations and the man will be duly cleansedBut if he is poor and his hand is not able to find what has been said he shall take a lamb as an offering for transgression so that the priest may pray for him and a tenth part of fine wheat flour sprinkled with oil as a sacrifice and a twelfth hin of oiland two turtledoves or two young pigeons of which one may be for sin and the other as a holocaustAnd he shall offer them on the eighth day of his purification to the priest at the door of the tabernacle of the testimony in the sight of the LordAnd he receiving the lamb for transgression and the twelfth hin of oil shall lift them up togetherAnd when the lamb has been immolated he shall place some of its blood upon the tip of the right ear of him who is being cleansed and upon the thumb of his right hand as well as the footYet truly he shall send part of the oil into his own left handand dipping the finger of his right hand in it he shall sprinkle it seven times before the LordAnd he shall touch the tip of the right ear of him who is being cleansed and the thumb of his right hand as well as the foot in the place of the blood which was shed for transgressionBut the remaining part of the oil which is in his left hand he shall send upon the head of the one being purified to appease the Lord on his behalfAnd he shall offer a turtledove or a young pigeonone for transgression and the other as a holocaust with their libationsThis is the sacrifice of a leper who is not able to obtain all of the things concerning his cleansingAnd the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron sayingWhen you will have entered into the land of Canaan which I will give to you as a possession if there is the mark of leprosy in a buildinghe whose house it is shall go and report to the priest saying It seems to me that the mark of leprosy is in my houseAnd he shall instruct them to carry all things out of the house before he would enter it and see whether it is leprosy lest all that is in the house become unclean And after this he shall enter to examine the leprosy of the houseAnd when he will have seen in its walls something like little hollows deformed with paleness or redness and lower than the remaining surfacehe shall exit by the door of the house and immediately close it up for seven daysAnd returning on the seventh day he shall examine it If he finds that the leprosy has spreadhe shall order the stones in which the leprosy is to be dug out and cast outside the city in an unclean placeand that the house be scraped on the inside all around and that the dust of the scrapings be scattered outside the city in an unclean placeand that other stones be put back in place of those which had been taken away and that the house be plastered with other mortarBut if after the stones have been dug out and the dust wiped away and it is plastered with other claythe priest upon entering will have seen that the leprosy has returned and that the walls are sprinkled with spots then it is a persistent leprosy and the house is uncleanAnd so they shall promptly destroy it and shall cast its stones and timber and also all the dust outside the town in an unclean placeWhoever enters into the house when it is closed up shall be unclean until eveningAnd whoever will have slept in it or eaten anything shall wash his clothesBut if the priest upon entering will have seen that the leprosy has not spread in the house after it had been newly plastered he shall purify it restoring it to healthAnd for its purification he shall take two sparrows and cedar wood and vermillion as well as hyssopand having immolated one sparrow in an earthen vessel over living watershe shall take the cedar wood and the hyssop and the scarlet and the living sparrow and he shall dip all these in the blood of the immolated sparrow and also in the living water and he shall sprinkle the house seven timesAnd he shall purify it as much with the blood of the sparrow as with the living water and with the living sparrow and the cedar wood and the hyssop and the vermillionAnd when he has released the sparrow to fly freely away into the field he shall pray for the house and it shall be justly cleansedThis is the law of every kind of leprosy and plagueof the leprosy of garments and housesof scars and erupting pustules of a shining spot when the appearance is also variegatedso that it can be known at what time a thing is clean or uncleanAnd the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron sayingSpeak to the sons of Israel and say to them The man who undergoes a flow of seed shall be uncleanAnd then he shall be judged subject to this fault if a filthy fluid at each moment adheres to his flesh and gathers thereEvery bed on which he sleeps shall be unclean and every place where he sitsIf any man has touched his couch he shall wash his clothes and having washed with water he shall be unclean until eveningIf he will have sat where that man has sat he shall also wash his clothes and having washed with water he shall be unclean until eveningWhoever has touched his flesh shall wash his clothes and having washed with water he shall be unclean until eveningIf such a man has cast his spittle upon him who is clean he shall wash his clothes and having washed with water he shall be unclean until eveningThe saddle on which he has sat shall be uncleanAnd whatever has been under him who has undergone a flow of seed shall be polluted until evening Whoever carries any of these things shall wash his clothes and having washed with water he shall be unclean until eveningAll whom such a one has touched not having washed his hands before shall wash his clothes and having washed with water he shall be unclean until eveningIf he has touched an earthen vessel it shall be broken But if it is a wooden vessel it shall be washed with waterIf he who suffers from this affliction will have been healed he shall number seven days after his cleansing and having washed his clothes and his entire body in living water he shall be cleanThen on the eighth day he shall take two turtledoves or two young pigeons and he shall advance in the sight of the Lord toward the door of the tabernacle of the testimony and he shall give these to the priestwho shall offer one for sin and the other as a holocaust And he shall pray for him before the Lord so that he may be cleansed from the flow of his seedA man from whom the seed of sexual intercourse goes out shall wash his entire body with water and he shall be unclean until eveningThe garment or skin which he will have he shall wash with water and it shall be unclean until eveningThe woman with whom he has had sexual intercourse shall be washed with water and she shall be unclean until eveningThe woman who at the return of the month undergoes the flow of blood shall be separated for seven daysAll who will touch her shall be unclean until eveningAnd everything on which she sleeps or sits in the days of her separation shall be pollutedWhoever will have touched her bed shall wash his clothes and having washed himself with water he shall be unclean until eveningAnyone who will have touched any item on which she has sat shall wash his clothes and having washed himself with water he shall be polluted until eveningIf a man has sexual intercourse with her in the time of her monthly flow of blood he shall be unclean for seven days and every bed on which he sleeps shall be pollutedThe woman who undergoes a flow of blood many days beyond her time of menstruation or whose blood does not cease to flow after the menstrual blood as long as she is subject to this affliction she shall be unclean just as if she were in her time of menstruationEvery bed on which she sleeps and every item on which she sits shall be pollutedWhoever will have touched these shall wash his clothes and having washed himself with water he shall be unclean until eveningIf the blood has stopped and has ceased to flow she shall number seven days for her purificationand on the eighth day she shall offer for herself to the priest two turtledoves or two young pigeons at the door of the tabernacle of the testimonyAnd he shall offer one for sin and the other as a holocaust and he shall pray for her before the Lord and for the flow of her uncleannessTherefore you shall teach the sons of Israel to be cautious of uncleanness so that they may not die in their filth when they will have polluted my tabernacle which is among themThis is the law of him who undergoes a flow of seed or who is polluted by sexual intercourseand of her who is separated in the time of menstruation or who has a continual flow of blood and of the man who sleeps with herAnd the Lord spoke to Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron when they were destroyed for offering strange fireAnd he instructed him saying Speak to your brother Aaron so that he may not at any time enter into the Sanctuary which is within the veil before the propitiatory by which the ark is covered so that he may not die (for I will appear in a cloud above the oracle)unless he will have done these things beforehand He shall offer a calf for sin and a ram as a holocaustHe shall be vested with a linen tunic He shall conceal his nakedness with linen undergarments He shall be wrapped with a linen belt and he shall impose a linen headdress on his head For these are holy vestments All of these he shall put on after he has been washedAnd he shall receive from the entire multitude of the sons of Israel two he-goats for sin and one ram as a holocaustAnd when he has presented the calf and has prayed for himself and for his own househe shall cause the two he-goats to stand in the sight of the Lord at the entrance to the tabernacle of the testimonyAnd casting lots over them both one is to be offered to the Lord and the other is to be the emissary goatThe one whose lot fell out to be offered to the Lord he shall offer for sinBut the one who is to be the emissary goat shall stand before the Lord so that he may pour the prayers upon him and may send him away into the wildernessAfter these things have been duly celebrated he shall offer the calf and praying for himself and for his own house he shall immolate itAnd taking up the censer which he has filled from the burning coals of the altar and drawing up with his hands the aromatic compound for incense he shall enter within the veil into the holy placeso that when the aromatics are placed upon the fire its cloud and vapor may cover the oracle which is above the testimony and he may not dieLikewise he shall take some of the blood of the calf and sprinkle it with his finger seven times opposite the propitiatory toward the eastAnd when he has slain the he-goat for the sin of the people he shall carry its blood within the veil just as he was instructed to do with the blood of the calf so that he may sprinkle it away from the area of the oracleand so that he may expiate the Sanctuary from the uncleanness of the sons of Israel and from their prevarications and every one of their sins According to this rite he shall act toward the tabernacle of the testimony which is fixed among them in the midst of the filth of their habitationLet no man be in the tabernacle when the high priest enters the Sanctuary in order to pray for himself and for his house and for the entire assembly of Israel until he exitsAnd when he has exited to the altar which is before the Lord let him pray for himself and taking the blood of the calf and of the he-goat let him pour it upon its horns all aroundAnd sprinkling with his finger seven times let him expiate and sanctify it from the uncleanness of the sons of IsraelAfter he has cleansed the Sanctuary and the tabernacle and the altar then let him offer the living goatAnd placing both hands upon its head let him confess all the iniquities of the sons of Israel and all of their offenses and sins And calling these down upon its head he shall send it away by means of a man prepared to do so into the desertAnd when the goat has carried all their iniquities into a solitary land and has been released into the desertAaron shall return into the tabernacle of the testimony And placing aside the vestments which he had worn before when he entered into the Sanctuary and leaving them therehe shall wash his flesh in the holy place and he shall be clothed in his own garments And departing afterwards he shall present his own holocaust and that of the people he shall pray as much for himself as for the peopleAnd the fat which is offered for sins he shall burn upon the altarYet truly he who has sent away the emissary goat shall wash his clothes and his body with water and so he shall enter into the campBut the calf and the he-goat which were immolated for sin and whose blood was brought into the Sanctuary to complete the expiation these shall be carried outside the camp and be burned with fire as with their skins so also with their flesh and dungAnd whoever will have burned them shall wash his clothes and flesh with water and so he shall enter into the campAnd this shall be to you an everlasting ordinance In the seventh month on the tenth day of the month you shall afflict your souls and you shall do no work neither someone native born nor the newcomer who sojourns among youOn this day there shall be atonement for you and also a cleansing from all your sins You shall be cleansed in the sight of the LordFor it is a Sabbath of rest and you shall afflict your souls as a perpetual observanceAnd the priest who has been anointed and whose hands have been consecrated to exercise the priesthood in the place of his father shall make atonement And he shall be clothed with the linen robe and the holy vestmentsAnd he shall expiate the Sanctuary and the tabernacle of the testimony and the altar likewise the priest and all the peopleAnd this shall be to you a perpetual law that you pray for the sons of Israel and for all their sins once a year Therefore he did just as the Lord had instructed MosesAnd the Lord spoke to Moses sayingSpeak to Aaron and his sons and to all the sons of Israel saying to them This is the word which the Lord has commanded sayingAny man at all of the house of Israel if he will have killed an ox or a sheep or a goat in the camp or beyond the campand not have presented it as an oblation to the Lord at the door of the tabernacle he shall be guilty of blood It is just as if he had shed blood so then he shall perish from the midst of his peopleTherefore the sons of Israel must offer to the priest their victims which they kill in the field so that they may be sanctified to the Lord before the door of the tabernacle of the testimony and so that they may immolate them as peace offerings to the LordAnd the priest shall pour the blood upon the altar of the Lord at the door of the tabernacle of the testimony and he shall burn the fat as a sweet odor to the LordAnd they shall no longer immolate their victims to demons with whom they have committed fornication It shall be an everlasting ordinance for them and for their posterityAnd you shall say to them The man of the house of Israel or of the newcomers who sojourn with you who offers a holocaust or a victimand who does not bring it to the door of the tabernacle of the testimony so that it may be offered to the Lord shall pass away from his peopleAny man at all of the house of Israel or of the newcomers who sojourn among them if he has eaten blood I will harden my face against his soul and I will drive him from his peopleFor the life of the flesh is in the blood and I have given it to you so that you may atone with it upon the altar for your souls and so that the blood may be for an expiation of the soulFor this reason I have said to the sons of Israel No soul among you shall eat blood nor among the newcomers who sojourn with youAny man at all from the sons of Israel or from the newcomers who sojourn with you whether by hunting or bird-catching if he seizes a wild beast or a bird which is lawful to eat let him pour out its blood and cover the earth with itFor the life of all flesh is in the blood Therefore I said to the sons of Israel You shall not eat the blood of any flesh at all because the life of the flesh is in the blood and whoever has eaten it shall perishThe soul who eats what has died on its own or what has been caught by a beast whether he is native born or a newcomer shall wash his clothes and himself with water and he shall be contaminated until evening And by this means he shall be made cleanBut if he will not wash his clothes and his body he shall bear his iniquityAnd the Lord spoke to Moses sayingSpeak to the sons of Israel and you shall say to them I am the Lord your GodYou shall not act according to the custom of the land of Egypt in which you have lived nor shall you behave according to the habit of the region of Canaan into which I will lead you neither shall you walk in their ordinancesYou shall accomplish my judgments and you shall observe my precepts and you shall walk in them I am the Lord your GodKeep my laws and judgments when a man does these he shall live

the nakedness of your brother’s wife for it is the nakedness of your brotherYou shall not uncover the nakedness of your wife and her daughter You shall not take her son’s daughter or her daughter’s daughter so as to uncover her dishonor for they are her flesh and such sexual intercourse is incestYou shall not take your wife’s sister as a rival mistress nor shall you uncover her nakedness while your wife is still livingYou shall not approach a woman who is undergoing menstruation nor shall you uncover her foulnessYou shall not have sexual intercourse with your neighbor’s wife nor shall you be defiled by the mingling of seedYou shall not give some of your seed to be consecrated to the idol Moloch nor to pollute the name of your God I am the LordYou shall not commit sexual acts with a male in place of sexual intercourse with a female for this is an abominationYou shall not commit sexual acts with any animal nor shall you be defiled by it A woman shall not lie down with a beast nor commit sexual acts with it for this is wickednessDo not pollute yourselves with any of these things by which all of the nations which I will cast out in your sight have been contaminatedand by which the land has been polluted I will visit the wickedness of the land so that it may vomit out its inhabitantsKeep my ordinances and judgments and do not do any of these abominations the native born as well as the settler who sojourns among youFor all these detestable things were done by the inhabitants of the land who were here before you and they have polluted itTherefore beware lest in a similar manner it may vomit you out as well if you do these same things just as it vomited out the people who were before youEvery soul who shall commit any of these abominations shall perish from the midst of his peopleKeep my commandments Do not be willing to do the things which have been done by those who were before you and do not be polluted by these things I am the Lord your GodThe Lord spoke to Moses sayingSpeak to the entire assembly of the sons of Israel and you shall say to them Be holy for I the Lord your God am holyLet each one fear his father and his mother Observe my Sabbaths I am the Lord your GodDo not be willing to convert to idols neither should you make molten gods for yourselves I am the Lord your GodIf you immolate a victim of peace offerings to the Lord so that he may be appeasedyou shall eat it on the same day as when it was immolated and the next day Then whatever will remain on the third day you shall burn with fireIf anyone after two days will have eaten from it he shall be profane and guilty of impietyAnd he shall bear his iniquity for he has polluted what is holy to the Lord And that soul shall perish from his peopleWhen you will have harvested the grain fields of your land you shall not cut it down to the surface of the land even to the ground nor shall you gather the remaining ears of grainNeither shall you gather the clusters

am the LordYou shall not do what is unjust nor shall you judge unjustly You shall not consider the reputation of the poor nor shall you honor the countenance of the powerful Judge your neighbor justlyYou shall not be a detractor nor a whisperer among the people You shall not stand against the blood of your neighbor I am the LordYou shall not hate your brother in your heart but reprove him

not cause your cattle to breed with other kinds of animals You shall not sow your field with diverse seeds You shall not be clothed with a garment which has been woven from two thingsIf a man will have slept in sexual intercourse with a woman who is a servant and who is also able to be married and yet he has not redeemed her with a price nor paid to set her free they both shall be beaten but they shall not die for she was not a free womanBut for his offense he shall offer a ram to the Lord at the door of the tabernacle of the testimonyAnd the priest shall pray for him and for his sin before the Lord and he shall win his favor again for him and the sin shall be forgivenWhen you will have entered into the land and will have planted in it fruit trees you shall take away their first-fruits the fruit that germinates shall be unclean to you neither shall you eat from theseBut in the fourth year all their fruit shall be sanctified for the praise of the LordAnd in the fifth

newcomer lives in your land and abides among you do not reproach himbut let him be among you like one native born And you shall love him as yourselves For you were also newcomers in the land of Egypt

measure be equal I am the Lord your God who led you away from the land of EgyptKeep all my precepts and all my judgments and accomplish them I am the LordAnd the Lord spoke to Moses sayingYou shall speak these things to the sons of Israel A man among the sons Israel or among the newcomers who live in Israel if he will have given from his seed to the idol Moloch he shall be put to death the people of the land shall stone himAnd I will set my face against him And I will cut him down from the midst of his people because he has given from his seed to Moloch and he has contaminated my Sanctuary and polluted my holy nameBut if the people of the land having been neglectful and holding little regard for my authority release the man who has given from his seed to Moloch and they are not willing to kill himI will set my face over that man and over his kindred and I will cut down both him and all who consented with him to fornicate with Moloch from the midst of their peopleThe

my laws as well as my judgments and act according to them lest the land into which you will enter and live may vomit you out tooDo not be willing to walk by the ordinances of the nations which I will expel before you For they have done all these things and so I abominate themBut I say to you Possess their land which I will give to you as an inheritance a land flowing with milk and honey I am the

among his own peopleHe shall not mingle the stock of his family with the common people of his nation For I am the Lord who sanctifies himAnd the Lord spoke to Moses sayingSay to Aaron A man from your offspring throughout their families who has a blemish shall not offer the bread to his GodNeither shall he approach to minister to him if he is blind if he is lame if he is small or large or has a crooked noseif his foot or hand is brokenif he has a bulging back or bleary eyes or if he has a white spot in his eye or a chronic scab or a skin disease on his body or a herniaAnyone from the offspring of Aaron the priest who has a blemish shall not approach to offer sacrifices to the Lord nor the bread to his GodNevertheless he shall eat from the loaves which are offered in the SanctuaryBut even so he may not enter within the veil nor approach to the altar For he has a blemish and he must not contaminate my Sanctuary I am the Lord who sanctifies themTherefore Moses spoke to Aaron and to his sons and to all of Israel everything that had been commanded to himThe Lord also spoke to Moses sayingSpeak to Aaron and to his sons so that they may be careful of those things which have been consecrated for the sons of Israel and so that they may not contaminate the name of the things sanctified to me which they offer I am the LordSay to them and to their posterity Every man of your stock who approaches toward those things which have been consecrated and which the sons of Israel have brought forward to the Lord in whom there is uncleanness shall perish before the Lord I am the LordThe man of the offspring of Aaron who is a leper or who is suffering a flow of seed shall not eat of those things which have been sanctified to me until he is healed Whoever will have touched what is unclean because of the dead and he whose seed goes out from him as if from sexual intercourseand whoever has touched a creeping thing or any kind of unclean thing the touching of which is filthyshall be unclean until evening and shall not eat those things which have been sanctified But when he has washed his flesh with waterand the sun has set then having been purified he shall eat from what has been sanctified because it is his foodWhatever dies on its own and whatever has been seized by a wild beast they shall not eat nor shall they be polluted by these I am the LordLet them observe my precepts so that they may not fall under sin and die in the Sanctuary when they will have defiled it I am the Lord who sanctifies themNo foreigner shall eat from what has been sanctified a guest of the priests and a hired servant shall not eat from themBut whomever the priest has bought and whoever has been born into his house these shall eat from themIf the daughter of a priest has been married to any of the people she shall not eat from what has been sanctified nor from the first-fruitsBut if she is a widow or divorced and being without children she returns to her father’s house she shall be nourished by her father’s foods just as she was accustomed to do as a girl No foreigner shall have the authority to eat from themWhoever through ignorance eats from what has been sanctified shall add a fifth part to that which he ate and he shall give it to the priest at the SanctuaryAnd they shall not contaminate what has been sanctified from the sons of Israel which they offer to the Lordlest perhaps they may suffer the iniquity of their offense when they will have eaten what has been sanctified I am the Lord who sanctifies themAnd the Lord spoke to Moses sayingSpeak to Aaron and to his sons and to all the sons of Israel and you shall say to them The man from the house of Israel or from the newcomers who live with you who would bring forward his oblation either fulfilling his vows or offering spontaneously whatever he brings forward as a holocaust for the Lordin order to be offered through you shall offer an immaculate male from the oxen or from the sheep or from the goatsIf it has a blemish you shall not offer it and it shall not be acceptableThe man who will have offered a victim of peace offerings to the Lord either fulfilling his vows or offering spontaneously whether of oxen or of sheep shall offer what is immaculate so that it may be acceptable There shall be no blemish in itIf it is blind or if it is broken or if it has a scar or if it is has a boil or a skin disease or infection you shall not offer these to the Lord nor shall you burn any of these upon the altar of the LordAn ox or a sheep having an amputated ear or tail you are able to offer voluntarily but a vow is not able to be fulfilled by theseYou shall not offer to the Lord any animal which has the testicles bruised or crushed or cut and taken away and you shall not cause any of these things in your landFrom the hand of a foreigner you shall not offer bread to your God nor anything else that he would choose to give for all this has been corrupted and blemished You shall not accept themAnd the Lord spoke to Moses sayingAn ox a sheep or a goat when they have been born shall be under the udder of their mother for seven days But on the eighth day and thereafter they are able to be offered to the LordWhether it is an ox or a sheep they shall not be immolated on the same day with their newbornsIf you immolate a victim as an act of thanksgiving to the Lord so that he may be pleasedyou shall eat it on the same day none of it shall remain until morning on the next day I am the LordObserve my commandments and do them I am the LordDo not pollute my holy name so that I may be sanctified in the midst of the sons of Israel I am the Lord who sanctifies youand who led you away from the land of Egypt so that I may be to you as God I am the LordAnd the Lord spoke to Moses sayingSpeak to the sons of Israel and you shall say to them These are the feasts of the Lord which you shall call holyFor six days you shall do work the seventh day because it is the rest of the Sabbath shall be called holy You shall do no work on that day it is the Sabbath of the Lord in all your dwelling placesTherefore these are the feasts of the Lord which you must celebrate in their timesThe first month the fourteenth day of the month at evening is the Passover of the LordAnd the fifteenth day of this month is the solemnity of the unleavened bread of the Lord For seven days shall you eat unleavened breadThe first day shall be greatly honored and holy to you you shall do no servile work in itBut you shall offer a sacrifice with fire for seven days to the Lord Then the seventh day shall be more honored and more holy and you shall do no servile work in itAnd the Lord spoke to Moses sayingSpeak to the sons of Israel and you shall say to them When you will have entered into the land which I will give to you and you will have harvested your grain fields you shall carry the sheaves of grain the first-fruits of your harvest to the priestHe shall lift up a sheaf before the Lord on the day after the Sabbath so that it may be acceptable for you and he shall sanctify itAnd on the same day that the sheaf is consecrated a one-year-old immaculate lamb shall be slain as a holocaust of the LordAnd the libations shall be offered with it two-tenths of fine wheat flour sprinkled with oil as an incense and a most sweet odor for the Lord likewise libations of wine the fourth part of a hinBread and parched grain and boiled grain you shall not eat from the grain field until the day when you shall offer from it to your God It is an everlasting precept in your generations and in all of your dwelling placesTherefore you shall number from the day after the Sabbath in which you offered a sheaf of the first-fruits seven full weeksall the way to the day after the completion of the seventh week that is fifty days and then you shall offer a new sacrifice to the Lordfrom all of your dwelling places two loaves from the first-fruits from two-tenths of leavened fine wheat flour which you shall bake as the first-fruits of the LordAnd you shall offer with the bread seven immaculate one-year-old lambs and one calf from the herd and two rams and these shall be a holocaust with their libations as a most sweet odor to the LordYou shall also offer a he-goat for sin and two one-year-old lambs as victims of peace offeringsAnd when the priest has lifted them up with the loaves of the first-fruits in the sight of the Lord they shall fall to his useAnd you shall call this day most honored and most holy you shall do no servile work in it It shall be an everlasting ordinance in all your dwelling places and generationsAnd when you will have harvested the grain fields of your land you shall not cut it down all the way to the ground neither shall you gather the remnants of the ears of grain but you shall leave these for paupers and strangers I am the Lord your GodAnd the Lord spoke to Moses sayingSay to the sons of Israel The seventh month the first day of the month shall be a Sabbath for you a memorial with the sounding of trumpets and it shall be called holyYou shall do no servile work in it and you shall offer a holocaust to the LordAnd the Lord spoke to Moses sayingThe tenth day of this seventh month shall be the day of atonement it shall be most honored and it shall be called holy And you shall afflict your souls on that day and you shall offer a holocaust to the LordYou shall do no servile work in the time of this day for it is a day of propitiation so that the Lord your God may be merciful to youEvery soul that has not been afflicted on this day shall perish from his peopleand anyone who will have done work I shall wipe him away from his peopleTherefore you shall do no work on that day This shall be an everlasting ordinance for you in all your generations and dwelling placesIt is a Sabbath of rest and you shall afflict your souls beginning on the ninth day of the month from evening until evening you shall celebrate your SabbathsAnd the Lord spoke to Moses sayingSay to the sons of Israel From the fifteenth day of this seventh month there shall be the Feast of Tabernacles seven days for the LordThe first day shall be called most honored and most holy you shall do no servile work in itAnd for seven days you shall offer holocausts to the Lord Likewise the eighth day shall be most honored and most holy and you shall offer holocausts to the Lord For it is the day of assembly and gathering You shall do no servile work in itThese are the feasts of the Lord which you shall call most honored and most holy and in them you shall offer oblations to the Lord holocausts and libations according to the rite of each particular dayaside from the Sabbaths of the Lord and your donations and that which you offer by a vow or which you give to the Lord spontaneouslyTherefore from the fifteenth day of the seventh month when you will have gathered together all the fruits of your land you shall celebrate the feast of the Lord for seven days The first day and the eighth day shall be a Sabbath that is a day of restAnd you shall take for yourselves on the first day the fruits of the most beautiful tree and branches of palm trees and branches of trees with thick foliage and willows from the torrent And you shall rejoice in the sight of the Lord your GodAnd you shall celebrate its solemnity for seven days each year This shall be an everlasting ordinance in your generations In the seventh month you shall celebrate the feastand you shall live under shelters for seven days All who are of the family of Israel shall dwell in tabernaclesso that your posterity may learn that I caused the sons of Israel to live in tabernacles when I led them away from the land of Egypt I am the Lord your GodAnd Moses spoke about the solemnities of the Lord to the sons of IsraelAnd the Lord spoke to Moses sayingInstruct the sons of Israel so that they may bring to you clear oil from the purest olives in order to supply the lamps continuouslyoutside the veil of the testimony in the tabernacle of the covenant And Aaron shall place these from evening until morning before the Lord as a perpetual worship and ritual in your generationsThey shall be placed upon the most pure candlestick in the sight of the Lord alwaysYou shall also receive fine wheat flour and you shall bake twelve loaves from it each loaf of which shall have two-tenthsAnd you shall arrange them six on each side upon the most pure table before the LordAnd you shall place upon them the clearest frankincense so that the bread may be a memorial of oblation for the LordOn each Sabbath they shall be changed before the Lord having been received from the sons of Israel as an everlasting covenantAnd they shall be for Aaron and his sons so that they may eat these in the holy place for it is the Holy of holies from the sacrifices of the Lord as a perpetual rightThen behold the son of an Israelite woman whom she had born of an Egyptian man among the sons of Israel going out was quarreling in the camp with a man of IsraelAnd when he had blasphemed the name and had cursed it he was led to Moses (Now his mother was called Shelomith the daughter of Dibri from the tribe of Dan)And they sent him to prison until they might know what the Lord would commandwho spoke to Mosessaying Lead away the blasphemer beyond the camp and let all who heard him place their hands upon his head and let the entire people stone himAnd you shall say to the sons of Israel The man who curses his God shall bear his sinand whoever will have blasphemed the name of the Lord shall be put to death The entire multitude shall overwhelm him with stones whether he be a citizen or a sojourner Whoever blasphemes the name of the Lord shall be put to deathWhoever will have struck and killed a man shall be put to deathWhoever will have struck down an animal shall repay its equivalent that is a life for a lifeWhoever will have inflicted a blemish on any of his citizens just as he has done so shall it be done to himfracture for fracture eye for eye tooth for tooth shall he repay Whatever degree of blemish he has inflicted so shall he be compelled to sufferWhoever strikes down a beast shall repay another Whoever strikes a man shall be punishedLet there be equal judgment among you whether it is a sojourner or a citizen who will have sinned For I am the Lord your GodAnd Moses spoke to the sons of Israel And they led away him who had blasphemed beyond the camp and they overwhelmed him with stones And the sons of Israel did just as the Lord had instructed MosesAnd the Lord spoke to Moses on mount Sinai sayingSpeak to the sons of Israel and you shall say to them When you will have entered into the land which I will give to you rest on the Sabbath of the LordFor six years you shall sow your field and for six years you shall care for your vineyard and you shall gather its fruitsBut in the seventh year there shall be a Sabbath of the land a resting of the Lord You shall not sow your field and you shall not care for your vineyardWhat the soil shall spontaneously produce you shall not harvest And you shall not gather the grapes of the first-fruits as a crop For it is a year of rest for the landBut these shall be yours for food for you and for your men and women servants and for your hired hands and for the newcomers who sojourn with youall that grows on its own shall provide food for your beasts and cattleYou shall also number for yourselves seven weeks of years that is seven times seven which together makes forty-nine yearsAnd you shall sound the trumpet in the seventh month on the tenth day of the month at the time of the atonement throughout all your landAnd you shall sanctify the fiftieth year and you shall proclaim a remission for all the inhabitants of your land for the same is the Jubilee A man shall return to his possession and each one shall go back to his original familyfor it is the Jubilee and the fiftieth year You shall not sow and you shall not reap what grows in the field of its own accord and you shall not gather the first-fruits of the cropdue to the sanctification of the Jubilee But you shall eat them as they present themselvesIn the year of the Jubilee all shall return to their possessionsWhen you will sell anything to your fellow citizen or buy anything from him do not cause your brother grief but buy from him according to the number of years from the Jubileeand he shall sell to you according to the computation of the produceThe more years that will remain after the Jubilee the more the price shall increase and the less the time is numbered so much less shall the purchase price be For he will sell to you the time for the produceDo not be willing to afflict your countrymen but let each one fear his God For I am the Lord your GodAccomplish my precepts and observe my judgments and complete them so that you may be able to live in the land without any fearand so that the soil may produce its fruits for you from which you may eat even to fullness dreading violence by no oneBut if you will say What shall we eat in the seventh year if we do not sow and do not gather our produceI will give my blessing to you in the sixth year and it shall yield the produce of three yearsAnd in the eighth year you shall sow but you shall eat from the old produce until the ninth year until what is new matures you shall eat what is oldAlso the land shall not be sold in perpetuity for it is mine and you are newcomers and settlers to meTherefore every region of your possession shall be sold under the condition of redemptionIf your brother being in need will have sold his little possession and his close relative is willing he is able to redeem what he had soldBut if he has no near relative and he himself is able to find the price to redeem itthe produce shall be calculated from that time when he sold it And what is lacking he shall repay to the buyer and so he shall receive his possessionBut if his hand will not have discovered a way to repay the price the buyer shall have what he bought until the year of the Jubilee For in that year all that has been sold shall return to the owner and to the original possessorWhoever will have sold a house within the walls of a city shall have the freedom to redeem it until one year has been completedIf he has not redeemed it and the year will have turned full circle the buyer and his posterity shall possess it in perpetuity and it is not able to be redeemed even in the JubileeBut if the house is in a village which has no walls it shall be sold by the law of the fields If it has not been redeemed beforehand then in the Jubilee it shall return to the ownerThe buildings of the Levites which are in the cities are always able to be redeemedIf they have not been redeemed then in the Jubilee they shall return to the owners for the houses of the cities of the Levites are for their possession among the sons of IsraelBut let not their suburbs be sold for it is an everlasting possessionIf your brother has become impoverished or infirm of hand and you take him in like a newcomer or a sojourner and he lives with youdo not accept usury from him nor anything more than what you gave Fear your God so that your brother may be able to live with youYou shall not give him your money by usury nor exact from him an overabundance of produceI am the Lord your God who led you away from the land of Egypt so that I might give to you the land of Canaan and so that I may be your GodIf your brother having been compelled by poverty will have sold himself to you you shall not oppress him with the servitude of indentured servantsBut he shall be like a hired hand or a settler he shall work with you until the year of the JubileeAnd after that he shall depart with his children and he shall return to his kindred to the possession of his fathersFor these are my servants and I led them away from the land of Egypt let them not be sold into the condition of servitudeDo not afflict him by power but be fearful of your GodLet your male and female servants be from the nations which are all around youand from the newcomers who sojourn with you or who have been born from them in your land These you shall have as servantsand by the right of inheritance you shall transmit them to your posterity and you shall possess them forever But do not oppress your brothers the sons of Israel by powerIf the hand of a newcomer or a sojourner will have grown strong among you and your brother having become impoverished will have sold himself to him or to any of his stockafter the sale he is able to be redeemed Whoever is willing among his brothers shall redeem himeither the paternal uncle or the paternal uncle’s son or his close relative by blood or by affinity But if he himself will be able also he shall redeem himselfconsidering only the years from the time of his selling until the year of the Jubilee and calculating the money for which he was sold according to the number of years and the accounting of a hired handIf there will have been many years which remain until the Jubilee according to these shall he also repay the priceIf few he shall determine the accounting with him according to the number of years and he shall repay to the buyer by what is left remaining of the yearshis wages being charged by what served before He shall not afflict him violently in your sightBut if by these means he will not be able to be redeemed then in the year of the Jubilee he shall depart with his childrenFor they are my servants the sons of Israel whom I led away from the land of EgyptI am the Lord your God You shall not make for yourselves an idol or a graven image Neither shall you erect a monument or set up a conspicuous stone in your land in order that you may adore it For I am the Lord your GodObserve my Sabbaths and be fearful toward my Sanctuary I am the LordIf you will walk in my precepts and observe my commandments and accomplish them I will give to you rain in its timeand the ground shall bring forth its seedlings and the trees shall be filled again with fruitThe threshing of the harvest shall last until the vintage and the vintage shall overtake the sowing And you shall eat your bread to fullness and you shall live in your land without fearI will give peace to your most distant regions You will sleep and there will be no one to strike you with terror I will take away harmful wild beasts and the sword will not cross your bordersYou will pursue your enemies and they will fall down at the sight of youFive of yours will pursue a hundred foreigners and a hundred of you will pursue ten thousand Your enemies will fall by the sword in your sightI will look with favor upon you and I will cause you to increase you will be multiplied and I will confirm my covenant with youYou will eat the oldest of what is old and when what is new arrives you will throw away what is oldI will set my tabernacle in your midst and my soul will not cast you outI will walk among you and I will be your God and you shall be my peopleI am the Lord your God who led you away from the land of the Egyptians lest you serve them and who broke the chains around your necks so that you would walk uprightBut if you will not listen to me nor accomplish all of my commandmentsif you despise my laws and disdain my judgments so that you do not accomplish those things which have been established by me and so that you lead my covenant away into nullificationthen I also will do these things to you I will quickly visit you with destitution and burning heat which will waste away your eyes and consume your lives In vain will you sow your seed which will be devoured by your enemiesI will set my face against you and you will fall down before your enemies and you will be subjugated to those who hate you You will flee though no one pursuesBut if you will not be obedient to me in this way then I will add sevenfold to your chastisement because of your sinsAnd I will crush the pride in your hardness and I will give to you heaven above like iron and the earth below like brassYour labor will be consumed to no purpose the land will not bring forth seedlings nor will the trees provide their fruitIf you walk as an adversary to me and if you are not willing to listen to me I will add sevenfold to your plagues because of your sinsAnd I will send upon you the wild beasts of the field which will consume you and your cattle and which will reduce everything to paucity and cause your roadways to become desolateBut if you are not willing to receive discipline in this way and you still walk as an adversary to melikewise I will advance against you as an adversary and I will strike you seven times because of your sinsAnd I will lead over you the sword that shall avenge my covenant And when you will have fled into the cities I will send a pestilence into your midst and you will be delivered into the hands of your enemiesAfter this I will have broken the staff of your bread so that ten women bake bread in one oven and distribute it by weight And you shall eat and not be filledThen if you will not listen to me through these things and you still walk against methen I also will advance against you with an opposing fury and I will chastise you with seven plagues because of your sinsso much so that you will eat the flesh of your sons and your daughtersI will destroy your high places and I will break apart your false images You will fall among the ruins of your idols and my soul will abominate youso much so that I will reduce your cities to a wilderness and I will make your Sanctuaries desolate and I will no longer accept the most sweet odorsAnd I will utterly ruin your land and your enemies shall be stupefied at it when they will have become its inhabitantsThen I will scatter you among the Gentiles and I will unsheathe the sword after you And your land will be deserted and your cities will be demolishedThen the land will be pleased by her Sabbaths throughout all the days of her solitude So while you will bein the land of the enemy she will worship and rest in the Sabbath of her solitude because she will not have rested in your Sabbaths when you lived in herAnd whoever of you will remain I will send terror into their hearts in the regions of their enemies The sound of a flying leaf will terrify them and so they will flee as if from the sword They will fall though no one pursuesAnd they will each fall upon their brothers as if they were fleeing from wars no one among you will dare to resist your foesYou will perish among the Gentiles and the land of the enemy will consume youBut if some few of these still remain they shall waste away in their iniquities in the land of their enemies and they will be afflicted because of the sins of their fathers and their own sinsuntil they confess their iniquities and those of their ancestors by which they have transgressed against me and walked as adversaries to meTherefore I also will walk against them and I will lead them into a hostile land until their uncircumcised mind shall be ashamed Then shall they pray on behalf of their impietyAnd I will remember my covenant which I formed with Jacob and Isaac and Abraham I will also remember the landwhich when she will be left behind by them shall be pleased by her Sabbaths enduring solitude because of them Yet truly they shall pray for their sins because they cast aside my judgments and they despised my lawsAnd even after so much when they were in the land of their enemy I did not cast them off entirely and I did not so despise them that they would be consumed nor so that I would nullify my covenant with them For I am the Lord their GodAnd I will remember my original covenant when I led them away from the land of Egypt in the sight of the Gentiles so as to be their God I am the Lord These are the judgments and precepts and laws which the Lord has granted between himself and the sons of Israel on mount Sinai by the hand of MosesAnd the Lord spoke to Moses sayingSpeak to the sons of Israel and you shall say to them The man who will have made a vow and espoused his soul to God shall give the price according to the estimationIf it is a male from twenty years to sixty years he shall give fifty shekels of silver by the measure of the Sanctuaryif it is a woman thirtyBut from the fifth year until the twentieth a male shall give twenty shekels a female tenFrom one month until the fifth year for a male five shekels shall be given for a female threeAt sixty years and beyond a male shall give fifteen shekels a female tenIf he is poor and he does not have the means to pay the estimation he shall stand before the priest and however much he will value him and see that he is able to pay so much shall he giveBut an animal which could be immolated to the Lord if anyone has vowed it shall be holyand it cannot be exchanged that is neither better for worse nor worse for better And if he has exchanged it both that which was exchanged and that for which it was exchanged shall be consecrated to the LordAn unclean animal which could not be sacrificed to the Lord if anyone has vowed it shall be led before the priestwho judging whether it is either good or bad shall set the priceBut if he who offers it was willing to give he shall add a fifth part above the estimationIf a man has vowed his house and he has sanctified it to the Lord the priest shall examine it whether it is good or bad and it shall be sold according to the price which he will have establishedBut if he who vowed it was willing to redeem it he shall give a fifth part beyond the estimation and he shall have the houseBut if he has vowed a field of his possession and has consecrated it to the Lord the price shall be estimated according to the measure of the seed If the land would be sown with thirty measures of barley then let it be sold for fifty shekels of silverIf he has vowed his field beginning from the current year of Jubilee as much as it may be worth so shall it be estimatedBut if after some amount of time the priest shall evaluate the money according to the number of years that remain until the Jubilee then the price shall be reducedBut if he who had vowed it was willing to redeem his field he shall add a fifth part of the money to the estimation and then he shall possess itBut if he is not willing to redeem it then it shall be sold to any other he who vowed it is no longer able to redeem itFor when the day of Jubilee arrives it shall be sanctified to the Lord And as a possession that has been consecrated it rightfully belongs to the priestIf a field has been bought and it is not from the possession of ancestors it shall be sanctified to the LordThe priest shall evaluate the price according to the number of years until the Jubilee and the one who had vowed it shall give to the LordThen in the Jubilee it shall be returned to the former owner the one who had sold it and who had held it within the lot of his possessionAll estimation shall be weighed according to the shekel of the Sanctuary A shekel has twenty obolsThe firstborn which belong to the Lord no one is able to sanctify or vow whether it is an ox or a sheep they are for the LordBut if it is an unclean animal whoever offers it shall redeem it according to your estimation and he shall add a fifth part to the price If he is not willing to redeem it it shall be sold to another for whatever amount it was estimated by youAll that is consecrated to the Lord whether it is a man or an animal or a field shall not be sold neither is it able to be redeemed Anything once it has been consecrated shall be the Holy of holies to the LordAnd all that has been consecrated which is offered by man shall not be redeemed but shall surely dieAll the tithes of the land whether from the grain or from the fruits of trees are for the Lord and are sanctified to himBut if anyone is willing to redeem his tithes he shall add a fifth part to themOut of all the tithes of oxen and sheep and goats which cross under the rod of the shepherd every tenth one that arrives shall be sanctified to the LordIt shall not be chosen by what is good or bad neither shall it be exchanged for another If anyone has exchanged it both that which was exchanged and that for which it was exchanged shall be sanctified to the Lord and shall not be redeemedThese are the precepts which the Lord commanded Moses for the sons of Israel on mount Sinai
